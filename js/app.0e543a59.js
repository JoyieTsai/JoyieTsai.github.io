Your mission is to protect the public from many kinds of harm. In order to accomplish this, your agency requires many different tools and supplies such as vehicles, radios, weapons, body armor, computers, flashlights, and so on. While your mission is providing public safety, much of your time is spent on the routine acquisition and maintenance of these necessary tools, equipment and supplies that allow your agency to operate. You purchase vehicles from auto and truck dealers, and have them serviced there; you purchase radios from communications companies …and so on. Government agency leaders are realizing that with limited resources and budgets, it is becoming more essential than ever to focus their resources on the mission.<br><br> Personnel in an agency are focused on the agency's charter; thus the training and expertise of its staff should be supporting this mission not on attending to tasks and activities that may be more cost-effectively performed outside. The Police Department certainly doesn't build its own guns. Nor would it hire staff to run an ”ammo-reloading division” within the agency. It's doubtful that you would service the inner parts of your radios or the building's plumbing if it broke that would be done by a professional plumbing company. You get the idea.<br><br> You get the supplies you need from outside specialists and professionals, while your staff focuses on your core mission and what they have been trained to do. You may be asking what does all this have to do with cloud computing?<br><br> More and more over the past decade, the leadership of many government agencies are making the decision to apply this same rationale (that is, sticking to the core agency focus) by getting their information processing needs handled by professionals who specialize in that area. During the 1990's, the first wave of this hit with the tremendous growth of CommercialOffTheShelf (COTS) software, a specialty of CSI. Today, agencies at all levels are procuring mostly all of their software needs by either purchasing or leasing the applications; fewer and fewer moderate and large sized government enterprises are writing homegrown applications these days.<br><br> Now, this same shift is taking place in the infrastructure area, as agencies are beginning to turn over the responsibility for providing and maintaining servers, storage, and network resources. This has led to the steady growth over the past five years of the adoption of cloudbased solutions for government, where the application does not reside on government servers, but on a “cloud.” The “cloud” is a secure IT environment set up in a remote location, where your application and your data are securely monitored and maintained. Not only does this relieve the government of administering the functions for maintaining an application and the hardware it resides on, but the state (or county) now does not have to purchase hardware, which often becomes outdated faster than the budgeting, purchasing or staffing of the agency can support. CSI has seen an increasing number of open bids such as RFP's and RFQ's permitting (some requiring) a fully hosted solution.<br><br> So what do the “experts” say about the use of cloud computing by government and law enforcement agencies? Two of the key organizations in this industry are the IACP (International Association of Chiefs of Police) and the IJIS Institute (Integrated Justice Information Sharing). Both have published provisions, endorsements and recommendations for the use of cloud computing.<br><br> The IACP says: Cloud computing technologies offer substantial potential benefits to law enforcement and government agencies. Cost savings, rapid deployment of critical resources, offsite storage and disaster recovery, and dynamic provisioning of new and additional resources when needed are among the tangible benefits that cloud computing potentially offers to law enforcement agencies of all sizes. (from IACP Cloud Computing Principles, January 2013 (http:// w w w . t h e i a c p . o r g / p o r t a l s / 0 / p d f s / GuidingPrinciplesonCloudComputinginLawEnforcement. pdf)<br><br> And after a Law Enforcement study and analysis performed by IJIS, they cite in their 'Conclusions' section of the document that: The risks identified in this study and the research into the cloud computing field, on which much of this analysis is based, lead to the conclusion that cloud computing is a valuable and reasonable approach to operating law enforcement missioncritical applications.<br><br> A misunderstanding exists among some in the law enforcement community that Law Enforcement data may not use cloud computing. This is not the case. There are, of course, important and strict requirements for a provider to meet to be in conformance with CJIS Security, as set forth by the FBI.<br><br> If you are considering a cloud solution, CSI is pleased to inform you of two key points<br> 1.

The IJIS Institute focuses on Inter-agency Justice Information Sharing and this symposium was a conference with speakers, demonstrations, and workshops to promote and optimize the effective sharing of information within and among Criminal Justice agencies. ”This year the IJIS Winter Briefing Symposium was an excellent mix of government agencies, vendors, public leaders, and academia. Former Governor and DHS Secretary Tom Ridge gave an excellent keynote address on the topic,” remarked Rein.<br><br>CSI continues to work with organizations such as IJIS because we recognize that it's not just about individual sales, projects, and profits.

Besides being police departments in New Jersey’s most populous county, they are all Bergen County police departments currently enjoying the benefits and features of the CSI’s newest suite of public safety offerings. Each of these agencies has its own InfoShare CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch), RMS (police Report Management System) and mobile application.<br><br>They have each also deployed the InfoShare™ Fleet Management and Permits/ Licensing modules and most have also installed our integrated Evidence module and e-Ticketing option.<br><br><h3>Many Firsts for Bergen County</h3><br>Little Ferry is the first police department in the state to purchase CSI’s new Live/Scan interface. With this interface, Little Ferry can streamline their booking process because the prints, palms and photos captured in LiveScan are automatically transmitted, with the booking information, directly to the InfoShare RMS. There, the arresting officer will find it stored with the case, and it can be accessed for reporting and future investigative action. Without the need for any redundant data entry, Little Ferry police officers can easily generate a hard copy information sheet with the defendant’s pedigree information, mug shot(s) and a set of identification prints.<br><br>Palisades Interstate Parkway (PIP) Police Department is the first police organization on InfoShare™ that has their own traffic statutes. When PIP officers write moving violation tickets on the Palisades Interstate Parkway, they do not use the New Jersey statewide Title 39 statutes. On this interstate roadway, they have their own statutes and the cases are heard in a separate court. This was a technical challenge to CSI; other vendors were not able to accommodate this requirement for e-Ticketing. But with CSI’s savvy engineers, the persistence of our dedicated Account Managers and the cooperation of the PIP police department, CSI developed the necessary design to meet the processing requirements of the PIP Police Department, as well as the certification requirements of the NJ AOC to upload ticket information to the state Judiciary’s ATS database.<br><br>Ridgefield Park is the first Bergen jurisdiction to use the e-Ticketing option on Android tablets for parking/metered offenses. The department is expanding its e-Ticketing use to their metered parking enforcement staff, who enter the tickets on their Android tablets and generate the paper ticket using portable wireless printers.<br><br><h3>CSI continues to provide innovative public safety products</h3><br>Besides forming partnerships with Sagem Morpho and Crossmatch that provided the LiveScan interface, CSI has recently joined with Lexus Nexus to develop another time-saving and accuracy-increasing feature that integrates the CRASH accident drawing tool in the InfoShare™ RMS. Also, the RMS can now transmit a pdf copy of the accident report to Lexux/Nexus, who processes the reports for the police departments.<br><br>These Bergen County police departments are using the InfoShare™ Fleet Management module. The module tracks where each vehicle has been, its daily mileage and other vehicle information. Service records can be set up so when a vehicle reaches the established mileage for specific maintenance, the system generates a notification that it is due for the service. Records of when and where the service was performed, the cost, and the mileage can be easily maintained in the module. InfoShare™’s Fleet Management module also tracks vendors and government contracts for vehicles and services.<br><br>CSI’s InfoShare™ Evidence module is a powerful evidence management system, a complete solution designed to automate the control of evidence tracking, saving department resources and improving efficiency. With the evidence module, the officer or investigator checks in each piece of evidence and the system tracks the chain of custody, barcodes and labels it, and record lab results. Once checked-in, the item is available for checkout or disposal, according to the agency’s procedures. Evidence logs and chain of custody reports are easily generated in real time. Once an item is checked in, the record becomes unavailable for modification. All movement of property items, from receipt in the Evidence Room right through to post-case destruction, permanent storage, or return to owner, is recorded.<br><br><h3>The Permits and Licenses modules</h3><br>is yet another part of this suite of products that gives these Bergen County police departments quick access to information on any permits or licenses that have been issued by their municipality. From dog licenses to gun permits, this module can be easily configured to keep track of any type of registration. They can track liquor licenses and all the employees of a tavern, taxi cab permits and a company’s licensed cab drivers, yard sale permits, building permits, pawn shop or other business registrations. Any type of permit or license that the town issues and the police department wants to track to keep its citizenry safe and its force efficient (and safe, too) can be configured and stored in the database. So if a call comes in reporting a suspected domestic violence incident in progress, the dispatcher can first check the Permits and Licenses module to see if a gun permit has been issued to anyone in the household. The officers can then arrive on the scene aware and prepared for what may be behind the door.<br><br>CSI welcomes these Bergen County police departments to our InfoShare family and is proud to provide them with the latest suite of law enforcement products.

It is not. Following the dots on a map and trying to figure out where the crime is occurring is a part of any good police practice. The importance of knowing where crime has occurred, where crime may occur and what the trends are is crucial to the success of any sound strategic plan. Unfortunately, too many agencies are simply relying on this surface information to conduct their ‘Intelligence-Led Policing Programs.’<br><br>“Real intelligence-led policing is way more complex than simple statistics. Do not misinterpret me, numbers are important, however, they only tell you part of the story,” says CSI’s Executive Vice President, Rich Norcross, a twenty-five year law enforcement veteran whose career includes twelve years as Camden County’s Commander of Intelligence Services. Take the crime of homicide, for example. Countless books and news articles have been written about murder and how to prevent it and/or predict it. You cannot begin to recite the number of experts who have appeared on any number of news outlets professing that homicide can be prevented, and then they quote you statistics. The sad truth is that killing is a crime of passion and, more importantly, opportunity. Certainly steps can be taken to prevent some crimes based on the numbers, but numbers leave out two things that are key to REAL intelligence-led policing – Who? and Why?<br><br><h3>The “Who?” and the “Why?”</h3><br>If you do not know who the criminals are or why they do the things they do, any policing effort is doomed to failure. “When I was the Intelligence Commander in Camden County, my job was to be able to answer these questions. Statisticians can tell you that X number of crimes occurred at Y locations. An Intelligence Officer must be able to tell you who could possibly be committing the crimes or, equally as important, why the crime was committed. Was one murder in retaliation for something else? Is there a turf war? Is there an internal power struggle in a criminal organization?” explains Norcross.<br><br>Collecting that information and storing it for future use is imperative. Regretfully, criminals do not schedule their crimes ahead of time so you must spread yourself out and take an “all crimes” and “all hazards” approach to the gathering. Countless burglaries, for example, get solved because police officers chase drug addicts. If the addicts themselves are not committing the crimes, they know who is.<br><br>Unfortunately, too many policy makers lack the intimacy with their jurisdictions that would allow them to definitely identify the problem people that exist in many communities. Often times, there is a lack of communication between the staff in the trenches and the staff behind the desks.<br><br>It is imperative that officers have easy ways to relate good intelligence information from the streets to the intelligence officers in any agency. At any given time during the day, countless officers are jotting down significant quantities of data in little notebooks that they carry in their pockets with no place to easily store the intelligence. It is pointless to ask the officers to fill out another piece of paper or make another computer entry because they are already overburdened as it is. With that said, the bottom line is that this information needs to be extracted from that officer somehow.<br><br><h3>InfoShare™ Gathers and Processes Intelligence Data for the Busy Officer!</h3><br>Many of our clients are aware of the steps that have been taken in New Jersey to connect the dots and bring all of the law enforcement intelligence services together in one sharing environment. The New Jersey Intelligence System Global Search has been used many times to solve crimes because it contains invaluable intelligence information that answers those two ever so important questions, “Who and Why?” This system is stocked with data, thanks to the tireless efforts of the various officers and detectives around the State.<br><br>CSI is now taking the cultivation of intelligence information to another new and exciting level in InfoShare. With the new ‘Push to Intelligence’ feature in our Police Records Management System (RMS) and Major Incident Management Systems (MIMS), officers perform their normal duties and then, instead of having to write another report, they can push a button and have the system generate an intelligence report for them. InfoShare™ then, automatically, bundles the report with any lookups, images and supporting documents and electronically forwards the intelligence report to the appropriate Intelligence Supervisor. This supervisor then reviews and grades this information to ensure that it is compliant with 28 CFR Part 23. In effect, we have made intelligence submission as easy as pushing a button.<br><br>With this new, innovative tool, InfoShare Intelligence users now have the ability to gather the statistics and have before them the information to answer those critical “who and why” questions. This is a big step towards true intelligence-led policing.<br><br>If your intelligence data is not telling you who and why, and your Intelligence Unit cannot utilize the data gathered to answer these questions, please contact CSI for a demo of our “Push to Intelligence” features.

There are also seven individual police departments, located n Bergen and Camden Counties, that have implemented both the InfoShare™ RMS and the integrated InfoShare™ CAD. We are rapidly adding more agencies to the CSI InfoShare™ family every month! Our growth can be attributed to our dedication in forming lasting client relationships with criminal justice and law enforcement agencies since the early 1990’s.<br><br>CSI would like to thank Independence Township Chief Dennis Riley, Town of Belvidere Chief Matthew Scott, Hackettstown Chief James Macaulay, Mansfield Township Chief Michael Reilly and Washington Township Chief James McDonald, Sr. for their dedicated cooperation and support in this project and for making CSI Technology Group their choice for Records Management/ Mobile/Evidence and e-Ticketing solutions."},{id:20,title:"Mercer County Implements Phase 2 of CJP in Municipal Courts",date:"5/29/2015",type:"news",src:"",body:"Camden, Atlantic, Middlesex, Gloucester and Mercer counties are experiencing the many benefits of CSI’s InfoShare™ CJP component for transmitting documents to the Prosecutor’s Office for case screening.<br><br>CSI initially developed the CJP module for Camden County several years ago, when the county court requested that the screening process time be reduced so that prisoners could be released if their charges were dismissed or downgraded.<br><br>“CJP”stands for Central Judicial Processing, and this InfoShare™ module allows the police departments in Camden, Atlantic, Middlesex, and Gloucester to transmit all indictable arrest documents, including complaints and police reports, to the Prosecutor's Office for timely screening decisions by prosecuting attorneys. The documents are scanned or uploaded to the case initiated by the local police department, thus creating an electronic case file that can be viewed by all authorized parties, and linking the initiated case directly to the e-Prosecution case.<br><br>In Mercer County, the InfoShare™ CJP component is being deployed with a slight variation to the established model. CJP was implemented at the Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office in 2013. There, CSI worked with the Prosecutor’s Office and one of the twelve municipal courts in the county to establish a Court-to-Prosecutor’s Office interface for their screening process. Ewing Township Municipal Court participated in this pilot program; here, the court staff transmits the data and the accompanying documents to the Prosecutor’s Office through CJP, making it the first court site to be deployed using CJP to interface with the Prosecutor’s Office.<br><br>The original copies of the complaints reside at the court, and these must be provided to the Prosecutor’s Office. Without CJP, someone from the prosecutor’s staff must travel weekly to all the municipalities to retrieve the documents for processing back at the Prosecutor’s office. With CJP in place, the time and expenses associated with the pickups are immediately eliminated. If the municipal judge has made notations on these documents, the court has the ability to scan the marked-up documents into CJP.<br><br>Other case documents, such as the Affidavit of Probable Cause, Victim/Witness Notifications, and the Letters of Representation, are also scanned into CJP and electronically transmitted to the prosecutor’s office, creating an electronic case file that is, within minutes, viewed and assessed by the screening attorneys. With all the initiating documents associated to the case, the county prosecutor is provided with a complete set of court documentation for the case, including the judge’s notations, to support the screening process in a timely manner.<br><br>After screening, those defendant records whose charges have been downgraded, dismissed, or remanded are electronically returned to the courts. When the defendant is charged and entered to PROMIS/Gavel, all documents are merged to the centrally located Prosecutor’s e-Prosecution case file. Besides reducing the time it takes to obtain the documents, using the CJP module eliminates redundant data entry and reduces the chances for data entry errors.<br><br>Some of the other benefits of using the CJP interface that have already been realized by Mercer County’s pilot implementation include:<br><br>> The Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office no longer needs to call the court to request faxed complaints for bail hearings<br><br>> Backlog is eliminated, as well as incorrect transfers on the AOCPROMIS/Gavel interface<br><br>> No disruptions due to scheduling and rescheduling, ultimately eliminating confusion between the courts and defendants/witnesses over new court dates and appearances<br><br>> Mercer County Prosecutors’ Office staff can scan complaints authored by their own detectives into InfoShare™ and the municipal court has instant access to them, thus eliminating the need to put cases in a “HELD” status in the court’s Automated Complaint System (ACS)<br><br>> There is a significant cost savings to the county, both in the Prosecutor’s Office and at the courts<br><br>Now, because of the realization of these benefits, two more Mercer County municipalities will begin entering the data and documents directly into InfoShare™ at their respective municipal courts. Starting this summer, Hamilton and Hopewell Township Municipal Courts will begin using CJP. Through the CJP interface, the screening attorneys at the Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office will find Ewing, Hamilton, and Hopewell township cases displayed in their inboxes, where they can just click on the case to access case information and related documents.<br><br>They will enter their screening decisions directly into the system, where they are immediately available to the municipal court, who can also view relevant letters from the attorney. Saving time, saving money, eliminating error and expediting time to trial are some of the major benefits of the InfoShare™ CJP module.

The CMCSO will also be using the InfoShare™ Records Management System (RMS).<br><br>CSI welcomes the opportunity to provide Cape May County with the latest technology for Computer Aided Dispatching services, integration with 911 emergency telephone services, and seamless linking to the records management system to provide for the collection and reporting of police-related incidents. These two agencies, OEM and the Sheriff’s Office, constitute the first phase of what promises to be a multi-phase project as the mission of the Communications Center grows over time.<br><br>When these InfoShare™ products are installed in Cape May County, they will come embedded with “geo-coding” features in the CAD and RMS. Geo-coding gives users the ability to look at area maps in specific “layers” that provide unique views for many purposes, from preventing crime to planning an evacuation route in the event of an approaching storm. With geo-coding, you can locate specific jurisdictional boundaries, demographic and zoning characteristics and even details such as pinpointing very specific items, like where fire hydrants are located or the boundaries of school zones.<br><br>The Communications Center mapping aspect of this project is fascinating, as Cape May County has a number of significant needs that are unique to their jurisdiction. For example, due to the large number of seasonal campgrounds and marinas in the area, the geo-coding has to include geo-codes for these unique jurisdictional locations. We will also need to include the flood plain mapping in the application, due to the many low lying areas of the County.<br><br>The Cape May County Sheriff’s Office is embracing the RMS application and will be using it to manage all facets of their agency, including their K-9 Unit. CMCSO has an extremely robust K-9 unit of trained, four-legged officers that serve the needs of the entire County of Cape May. Between Memorial Day and Labor Day, the jobs increase exponentially for the CMCSO as a whole, including the K-9 unit, due to the seasonal population increase.<br><br>In addition to serving the Sheriff’s Office, this project contains a significant Fire and Emergency Medical Service component.

This interface will also help ensure that prosecutors have the crucial information they need to deal with the new Bail Reform procedures.<br><br>The e-CDR system is used by all the law enforcement agencies in New Jersey to generate and file arrest warrants and summonses. This new data stream will assure the quality of the identification and charge data being entered on a prosecutor’s case by accurately populating the InfoShare™ database with case intake data directly from the e-CDR system, including:<br> > Defendant’s name<br> >  Defendant date of birth<br> > Defendant drivers license number<br> > Defendant social security number<br> > Defendant SBI number<br> >  Any other technical defendant identifiers available from the e-CDR<br> > All warrant and summons numbers associated with the case<br> > All charge codes from those warrants and summonses<br><br>Improving the quality of data at the intake stage will benefit case processing throughout the life of the case. When the case is prepared for presentation to the Grand Jury, having accurate charge information will help ensure that the indictment accurately reflects all the charges in the case and that all charges are disposed of properly when the case is re-coded into Promis Gavel after indictment. This will reduce the number of additional warrants that must be manually dismissed, in court or administratively, when the case is disposed of in court.

Have you tried it? Deployed it? Or perhaps have you spent a number of hours to try and prevent its take-­over of your organization’s PC workstations.<br><br>Do you like it? Or is it causing problems for your staff?<br><br>As you might imagine, these questions are drawing many and varied types of feedback from across the PC community. Let’s take a brief look at the early reactions to Windows 10, the strategy related to Microsoft and several InfoShare™ experiences with this latest operating system from Microsoft. Our intent here is to share some early feedback with you that you may want to consider for your computing portfolio.<br><br>How is it being viewed? Well, the opinions out there are wide-ranging. When it first came out, Michael Horowitz from Computerworld advised that it should be avoided, especially as it relates to enterprise deployment: Mr. Horowitz’s point was that although there are some cool and beneficial features, those that would most likely interest the home-user, student, or dabbler, the software maturity and compatibility issues right now seem to outweigh them.<br><br>Likewise, Woody Leonard, tech writer for InfoWorld, summarizes in their July 29 issue, “Windows 10 is what Windows 8 should have been, but it has too many rough edges to attract Windows 7 users. Continuous upgrades could change that as early as this fall”.<br><br>However, Leonard goes on to say, “After the truly wretched Windows 8 and marginally less wretched Windows 8.1, Windows 10 comes as a breath of fresh air. Windows 10 is much more usable than Windows 8 or 8.1 and proudly offers a bundle of new features, including improved security, a new browser, and the voice-activated intelligent assistant, Cortana.”<br><br>There are, of course, a number of positive reviews and those whose authors are presenting, and balancing, the benefits versus the drawbacks. Also on July 29, the day Windows 10 was released, Dan Grabham wrote on Techradar.com that “Featurewise, Windows 10 is the new Windows 7. It’s robust, pleasant to use and free.” Grabham reviewed Windows 10 again on October 6 with detailed and generally favorable reviews of many of its new features. You can review his thoughts on what he calls “Microsoft’s make-or-break operating system” at http:// www.techradar.com/us/reviews/pcmac/software/operatingsystems/ windows101267364/ review/3 . And if you can remember what privacy is and are concerned about Microsoft’s use of your data with Windows 10, you might want to check out how to adjust your privacy settings in the August 3 issue of Slate, available at http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/08windows_10_privacy_ problems_here_s_how_bad_they_are_ and_how_to_plug_them.html<br><br><img src='../img/news/news-2015-0817-1.jpg'><br><br>“There is one aspect about Windows 10 for which I’ve seen very little debate; it’s waaayyyy better than Windows 8, which is why the strategic importance of Windows 10 to Microsoft is so profound,” remarks CSI’s VP and CIO, Chris Rein. “It’s fair to make some generalizations and say that a) it’s new, b) it’s better than its predecessor, c) it’s not perfect and d) opinions vary. Not much surprise there.” From CSI’s perspective, we want to offer some of our experiences that you may find helpful, or at least worthy of your consideration, in your planning and use of Windows 10. Here goes:<br><br>i. General operation: We’ve upgraded and used a number of PC’s to Win10, and our experiences are generally pretty good. Of course, with a portfolio of web-based applications in our current customer sites that span over 15 years, the enterprise impact is going to vary.<br><br>ii. Compatibility: Windows 10 with IE-11 gets very good compatibility marks. IE-11 is being delivered and supported for just this type of use, enterprise & web applications. As far as your browser choice, IE-11 is where you want to be (and not out on the “bleeding edge”). If your InfoShare™ application has any issues with your implementation when you initially test it, which we strongly recommend you do, please reach out to your Account Manager for more specific information on your site’s configuration.<br><br>iii. Speed: On PC’s that meet or exceed the hardware requirements as suggested/ enforced by Microsoft, the performance seems rather good.<br><br>iv. It’s Aggressive! Since Microsoft is depending on wide acceptance and a faster-than-normal adoption across the industry, they are marketing it accordingly (i.e., free, at least for the first year). We have seen the clear evidence of how “aggressively” or persistently that Windows 10 tries to get itself installed as an upgrade. It notifies you with popups, fly-outs, messages, and, of course, in Windows Update, that it really wants you to move to Windows 10. So we recommend being vigilant about how you manage your updates until you are ready to install it.<br><br>Chris Rein alerts us to a “note of interest” concerning this operating system update and how he sees it relative to Microsoft’s direction concerning cloud computing. “Over the past five to ten years, it’s become impossible to go more than a day or so without seeing any cloud computing advertisements, promotions or technical journal articles. And, of course, the key terms that are associated with ‘the Cloud’ are: SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS (for Software, Platform, and Infrastructure, respectively), offered ‘as a service.’ Each of these is a different business and technical model for software hosting and support. We find it interesting that now, Microsoft is using Windows 10 to push the cloud’s footprint even further vertically, with their “Windows as a Service” paradigm, for which Windows 10 is their initial platform. Whereas IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS are distinct, meaning one can literally draw diagrams to show where the software components are installed and who maintains them, this is not exactly analogous to WaaS. Windows as a Service is not a model where your computer doesn’t have an operating system on it, as some may infer. Rather, it is more the operational and delivery method for their Windows upgrades and patches.” CSI invites you to share any experiences you have with Windows 10 with us."},{id:25,title:"INFOSHARE STOCKING STUFFERS!!",date:"8/27/2015",type:"news",src:"",body:"Are It’s that time of year again when your friends at CSI Technology Group want to share with you our ideas for how you can tidy up any loose ends in your capital budget before next year’s proposed budget gets submitted. Here are some suggestions of InfoShare™ modules you may want to consider to enhance efficiency for your organization.<br><br><h3>INTERNAL AFFAIRS MODULE</h3><br>CSI’s Internal Affairs module provides a countywide environment for prosecutor’s office staff and internal affairs officers in each police department to work in the same application, but as individual departments, when processing Internal Affairs cases. Incorporating standardized, formal disciplinary forms used by CALEA-certified departments in formal disciplinary actions, as well as the individual department’s investigation reports, the system accommodates all the local departments’ needs. Designed with the latest version of the Attorney General’s Internal Affairs Policy and Procedures in mind, the module incorporates the concepts of prosecutorial notification, prosecutorial review, standardized periodic reporting and early warning alerts to flag certain kinds of officer conduct. At the same time, the module allows local departments to handle their noncriminal internals in a segregated, digital environment with all the advantages of the full InfoShare™ system. Give your prosecutor the assurance he or she needs that the office is involved in managing all the serious internal affairs investigations in the county!<br><br><h3>EXTERNAL MODULE</h3><br>With Bail Reform legislation due to kick in at the end of 2016, much time will be spent in next year’s Prosecutor’s Offices’ operational meetings on determining how to manage the new court procedures accompanying Bail Reform and how to assure the public’s safety within the confines of the new procedures. CSI’s External Module incorporates a screening process that allows the Prosecutor’s Office to see criminal complaint documents as soon as they are uploaded by the local police departments. Potentially, this could mean that the Prosecutor’s Office can start evaluating a case for bail review before the defendant even reaches the county jail.<br><br>The reality is that the requirements of the Bail Reform legislation are focused on changing how the courts evaluate bail decisions and they give the Prosecutor’s Office little say in the new decision-making process. Bail reform requires the courts make a risk assessment and a decision about the conditions of release within 48 hours of the defendant being incarcerated in the county jail. The law allows prosecutors to have input into those decisions. The problem for prosecutors is that there is no requirement that the courts wait for that prosecutorial input. [See N.J.S. 2A:162-16.2.] Therefore, in order to have input into bail decisions, prosecutors must stay ahead of the court houses’ decision making time line. CSI’s External Module with screening process does just that. It allows a Prosecutor’s Office to see the complaints at the same time the court system gets them, or before, and allows prosecutors the time to muster their facts and arguments for protecting public safety."},{id:26,title:"September 01, 2015 INFOTRACKER: An Efficient Tool For Status Monitoring and Problem Resolution",date:"9/1/2015",type:"news",src:"",body:"Are you making a list and checking it twice?

The system they are implementing is CSI’s InfoAlert!, a product we have developed to support communities and school systems throughout the country. For schools in Upper Saddle River, InfoAlert! will facilitate implementing and maintaining their school emergency operations plans.<br><br>With InfoAlert!, everyone can stay informed of emergencies and dangerous situations. Communication between authorities and the community is readily available using a device people carry everyday… their smartphone, iPad or Android tablet. Using the InfoAlert! application, a school system or a citizen can alert their respective police department of an incident, nonverbally, by merely clicking on a tab and entering their emergency. This immediate process transmits the message directly to the police department’s dispatch console. The dispatcher can immediately process the information and, when necessary, create a Call For Service (CFS) from their Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD). GPS technology is embedded in the app to send responders to the scene, without the sender having to enter location information.<br><br>Public safety and campus security agencies can even pre-define lists to target messages to specific audiences. For instance, lists can be established prior to an emergency occurring so that a targeted communication can be directed to teachers or police officers or any other specific group. Also, to facilitate composing messages quickly during an emergency, agencies can pre-define message content into drop-down lists for easy selection. “These options make it easy for an agency to quickly get the word out in an emergency situation and mobilize the proper resources to respond,” explains Mike Trahey, Vice President for CSI’s Emergency Management Division.<br><br>In the case of a school lockdown resulting from an active shooting incident, InfoAlert! can place a silent alert to authorities, without tipping off a perpetrator that a call to police has been placed. During such emergencies, police, schools and citizens are able to send and receive nonverbal alert messages and photographs throughout the event, even when traditional forms of communication could put staff or students at risk. Someone hiding from an armed attacker can silently send a message to police, such as “I’m in the closet in room 202.”<br><br>In emergency situations such as Super Storm Sandy, a chemical spill from a truck on the turnpike or a terrorist attack at an airport, authorities can send out alerts to the general public with advice and warnings in one swift transmission. In a campus situation, alerts from campus security can warn students about pandemics, food poisoning outbreaks,class cancellations or a predator on campus. Bi-directional alerts and tip and information sharing provide the ability for both police and the public to transmit messages and images to each other. Authorities can provide information and instructions and citizens can report status or seek assistance, thus raising awareness of where trouble lies and how to deal with it. Photos of suspicious persons or vehicles can be transmitted to the police from citizens and vice-versa.<br><br>Give your citizens the added protection that comes from bi-direction communication in preparing for and managing emergencies! With InfoAlert!, the availability of instant communication between your citizens, schools and public safety agencies works to save lives.

They dug up audio from the calls reporting the incident to police headquarters while the Page 7 shootings were going on. They got footage from NBC News and interviewed Terry Ruggles, the reporter who was off to cover another story when the call about the Haddon Heights shooting came in and was redirected to cover that. They interviewed family members, including McLaughlin’s widow, Kim, and his two daughters, who were just little girls when they suddenly lost their dad; even twenty years later with children of their own, their grief still seems raw as they relate heart -wrenching stories of how they found out and how their lives changed forever that tragic day. They interview Rich Norcross and his wife, Karen, who tell about how Rich found out about his younger brother’s death, while fighting for his own life in a hospital bed a day later; he had not even known that John was at the scene. They interview the other officers assigned to the search that day, to officers that responded, and to McLaughlin’s colleagues at the Prosecutor’s Office. They recorded the memories of all of these different people affected by the incident and their accounts of how it all went down.<br><br>In April, after the research was completed, the crew began piecing it all together to create the documentary. On May 15, in honor of National Law Enforcement Officers’ Memorial Day, (2015) After Tragedy was released, telling a gripping story of the tragic day, from the many vantage points of those interviewed, interspersed with clips from Norcross’ lectures at police academies. The film opens on a sunny, spring day in quiet Haddon Heights, and then the calm is shattered by reports on a police radio about someone firing a gun at cops on Sylvan Avenue, and so the story begins to unfold. The drama of the reports of gunfire, the emergency response, the neighbors hiding for safety, the families’ grief, the somber funeral for the fallen and the survivors coming to terms with what happened, all reveal the story that touched so many innocent lives twenty years ago and today still has impact because Norcross will not let the story die, nor the memory of his brother and his comrade. “<br><br>“I want people to remember John Norcross and Jack McLaughlin’s sacrifice and I wanted to memorialize the courage of those that responded that day,” relates Norcross. Their memory will live on, as the film is already being used in several police academies in New Jersey and surrounding areas, including Philadelphia. (2015) After Tragedy has been sent to the National Concerns of Police Survivors, an organization that helps families of fallen officers, and to the National Police Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. Rowan University has entered it in several film festivals, including most recently at the Atlantic City Cinefest/Downbeach Film Festival in October.<br><br>With this documentary film, Rich Norcross and the Rowan University Department of Radio, Television and Film have left an indelible mark in history of the events of April 20, 1995, the community of Haddon Heights, New Jersey and the courage of the officers and responders involved in this tragic incident.

New Jersey’s most populous county will be getting CSI’s Total Police Solution, a fully integrated package that includes the InfoShare™ Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD), Records Management System (RMS), Mobile (MDT), and e­-Ticketing.<br><br>This CSI InfoShare™ solution will integrate the data and services of the County Department of Public Safety Dispatch Center, the Bergen County Sheriff’s Department, the newly­-formed County Patrol Division and the Prosecutor’s Office. The application will be equally distributed over three separate host sites, located at strategic locations throughout Bergen County to provide real­-time, redundant back-­up of all data for security and disaster recovery purposes.<br><br>This implementation, including the conversion of existing police data, will be accomplished in two phases. Phase One of the implementation will support the recent merger of the Bergen County Police Department and the Bergen County Sheriff’s Office with a totally integrated system for timely receipt, management, and sharing of police information in real time. This will require data conversion and CAD/ Mobile/Records Management/E-Ticketing integration. The installation of a Sheriff’s CAD will accommodate all prisoner transports and pickup, Calls for Service and Warrant/Fugitive Squad responsibilities. These units will utilize CSI InfoShare™ Mobile (MDT) technology with vehicle GPS tracking.<br><br>Phase Two, which will run concurrently with Phase One, will include the installation of InfoShare™ CAD at the Bergen County Law and Public Safety Dispatch Center, giving the center an enhanced ability to efficiently manage their regional dispatch responsibilities. The application will provide many new functions to better ensure timely response to calls for service, automatically locate the closest unit to the call for service location and provide for real time transfer of case information. This will include integration of the Center’s CAD with the InfoShare™ RMS, providing reporting capabilities for all dispatch units. The InfoShare ™ RMS enhances the reporting capabilities of these agencies with robust features such as access to Master Index information and report sharing functionality, including the ability to electronically submit reports and supporting documentation to the county Prosecutor’s Office electronically.

The goal of this portal project has been to develop an easy to use facility for citizens to access numerous municipal services via the Internet and make it more convenient for them to file paperwork, make applications and ask questions of the municipality.<br><br>“We are helping to provide something to the citizen that often is not possible in government service – CONVENIENCE. Superior public relations starts and stops greatly with how easily someone can accomplish something they need to do. Let’s face it, no one wants to go to City Hall to get forms and then go back again to turn them in with the fees. If this can be fully automated so that the citizen can do this on their terms and their time frame, this will result in a better relationship between the citizen and the government,” explains CSI Executive Vice President Rich Norcross.<br><br>CSI  This application is designed to be used by all of the different departments in a municipality. CSI has strived to create a system that will meet the working needs of every department from the Fire Department to Public Works, from the Municipal Clerk to the Zoning Official, and so on. Some of these services include:<br> > Obtaining, filling out and filing construction permits, to include payment of fees based on the fee schedule.<br> > Requesting white goods or other large bulk item trash pickup<br> > Fire inspections<br> > Dog / cat licenses<br> > Mercantile licenses<br> > Tax bill payments<br> > Permit applications, such as dumpster permits, block party permits, etc.<br> > Parking permits – <br> <p class='pl-3'>Overnight parking<br> Exemptions<br> Metered permits<br> Lot permits</p> > Limo / taxi permits<br> > Alarm permits<br> >  Vacation house checks<br> > Special needs notifications<br><br>Once these items are filed online, there will be a backend workflow controller that will allow the municipal staff to process the requests electronically. This will cut down on the cost of paper products, copiers, postage and other costs associated with a manual process. This is a “green” way of doing business, which is something that we all strive for in today’s society.<br><br>This application will be offered as a Software as a Service (SaaS) product, hosted on a secure government cloud and will be available to both municipalities and counties. This type of product offering is a cost effective way to cut down on hardware purchases and maintenance. Also by purchasing as a service, this ensures that your system is always up to date and using the latest technology, including the latest Internet security.<br><br>Please visit CSI at our booth at the upcoming New Jersey League of Municipalities Conference, November 17 – 19 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where we will be happy to show you the details and how this can increase efficiency and cost savings for your town.

This new product is integrated with the police Report Management System (RMS), putting the necessary data at your fingertips whenever needed.<br><br>“This module greatly assists in the tracking and monitoring of activity at alcoholic beverage establishments. It also serves to assist in the monitoring and approval of their employees,” states CSI Vice President Pete Ugalde, a retired captain of a police force that once had to monitor more than 34 bars over a 2.2 square mile radius. In the InfoShare™ ABC module, all of the necessary information about each licensed establishment (bars, liquor stores or any place selling alcoholic beverages) is captured.<br><br>The module also stores lists of registered employees for each establishment and the records of background checks that the police have done for those employees. Then, if an establishment is found to have a person working behind the bar or at the counter that has not been registered and has not had the proper background check, the police department can record this in the ABC module, where it will be stored for consideration at time of license renewal, as well as reported to the State Alcoholic Beverage Commission.<br><br>Ugalde explains, “When an establishment’s license comes up for renewal, it is not necessary to conduct various searches to ascertain if the establishment is a problem location for law enforcement. Simply look up the permit in the system and you will see all the activity at the location. Also, by review of the employee listing, you can identify if the appropriate approvals have been put in place.”<br><br>Through its integration with the InfoShare™ RMS, the police department has immediate access to incidents and reports that have been filed about the establishment or any of its employees. So, when a police department receives notification from the town that the license for Joe’s Rowdy Bar is up for annual renewal, the officer merely has to enter the establishment’s permit number into the system. The module then grabs any data that has been entered into the RMS about any person registered to be an employee, about any incident that has been investigated or any other report that has been filed on the establishment and provides it to the requesting officer. The police department can then easily determine if Joe’s place has indeed been rowdy and if the license should not be renewed for any reason.<br><br>Whether your town has five or five hundred alcoholic beverage establishments within its borders, the InfoShare™ ABC module is a straight up way to keep the whole license monitoring and renewal process neat."},{id:33,title:"CSI DEVELOPS INTERFACE BETWEEN THE NATIONAL INSURANCE CRIME BUREAU AND NEW JERSEY STATE INVESTIGATIVE AGENCIES",date:"11/1/2015",type:"news",src:"",body:"In cooperation with Verisk Analytics, a software program provider to the insurance industry, CSI developed a program to permit insurance company staff to electronically submit potentially fraudulent claims into the InfoShare™ application used by the NJ Attorney General’s Office of Insurance Fraud Prosecutor (OIFP) and the NJ Department of Insurance Bureau of Fraud Deterrence.<br><br>Insurance companies report fraudulent claims to the National Insurance Crime Bureau, which builds a database of claimants and service providers involved in such claims.

– R U OK?",date:"1/27/2016",type:"news",src:"",body:"Got acronyms? Of course you do. No doubt we find ourselves amidst a convergence of many technical and law enforcement acronyms, whether in journals, text messages, laws, operating procedures, you name it, everyday. “BYOD” is a fairly new acronym for “Bring Your Own Device,” referring to the FBI’s CJIS Security policy.<br><br>Ah! More acronyms! CJIS is Criminal Justice Information Systems, a division of the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation – of course, you knew that one). In the fourth quarter of 2015, the FBI CJIS division updated the CJIS Security Policy and several sections deal specifically with this important topic, BYOD.<br><br>CSI feels it is worth pointing out a few of the key references, requirements, and warnings regarding staff bringing their own devices to the agency. Of course, as it is the authoritative source, please do refer to the complete document for all the details (find it at https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ cjis-security-policy-resource-center ).<br><br>Many law enforcement agencies issue mobile devices currently, or are contemplating doing so.<br><br>On one hand, the value, in terms of communications and convenience, is obvious. For the past several versions of the policy, CJIS has recognized the availability of, and thus the growing need for addressing, mobile devices. But, as their policy points out, there are challenges in using these devices for accessing CJI (Criminal Justice Information), and especially so if they are personally owned. The policy states: “If personally owned devices are utilized within the environment (BYOD scenario), specialized and costly access control methods may be required to reach compliance with CJIS Security Policy.”<br><br>So, they go on to say...…“BYOD environments pose significant challenges to the management of secure device configurations. In many cases it may be impossible to apply effective security that is acceptable to the device owner or it may require extremely costly compensating controls to allow access to CJI on personally owned devices.<br><br>While allowed by the CJIS Security Policy, agencies are advised to conduct a detailed cost analysis of the ancillary costs of compliance with CJIS Security Policy on personally owned devices when they are approved for use.” “Two terms used increasingly when addressing this topic of mobile access and BYOD are “EMM” (Enterprise Mobility Management) and “MDM” (Mobile Device Management),” explains CSI’s VP and CIO Chris Rein. While we can’t get into all the details here, Rein recommends, “if your agency is considering implementation of mobile access, it will be necessary to have familiarization, or better yet, expertise, in what they are.<br><br>” MDM and EMM systems and applications, coupled with a device-specific technical policy, can provide a robust method for device configuration management, if properly implemented. MDM capabilities include the application of mandatory policy settings on the device, detection of unauthorized configurations or software/ applications, detection of rooting/ jailbreaking of the device, and many other security policy-related functions. In many cases, the most cost effective way to achieve CJIS Security Policy compliance on mobile devices is the selection of MDM or EMM applications and infrastructure appropriate to the mobile operating systems.<br><br>”A written and approved policy for your agency’s use of mobile devices is the cornerstone for compliance,” advises Rein. “And it is essential to distinguish whether you are implementing, or even allowing, personally owned devices or agency-issues ones.” He recommends the following essential considerations for your agency if considering a BYOD environment:<br><br> ● Solid understanding of Advanced Authentication<br><br> ● Understanding when Compensating Controls are applicable<br><br> ● Loss of Device (how to address & plan for)<br><br> ● Remote Data Erasure<br><br> ● Protecting against “Rooting” or “Jailbreaking”<br><br> ● Use of Mobile Device Management (MDM)<br><br> ● Use of Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM)<br><br>CSI serves a wide range of agencies that use, consume, store, and share CJI. These agencies also employ a variety of operational and technological policies and procedures that relate to their use of technology and communications. We encourage all of our customers to familiarize themselves and understand this important FBI CJIS policy and the need for proper conformance."},{id:2,title:"DISCOVERY: IT’S NO SIMPLE CHORE BUT INFOSHARE™ CAN HELP!",date:"2/8/2016",type:"news",src:"",body:"Getting discovery prepared on time for the first appearance, or organizing hundreds of documents from a large investigation and tracking the costs to the defense attorneys is no easy task.<br><br>So, why not let the Discovery component of InfoShare™ help with this critical process in the nts according to preference before! The Discovery tool processes all discoverable documents that are scanned, uploaded, or saved as templates in the InfoShare™ Documents record. The operator can organize the documents into packages and then move them to the redaction window for treatment.<br><br>Key words, Social Security Numbers and addresses can be redacted on an individual document basis or for the whole set of documents in a package. When working on those large documents that cannot be finished in one sitting, you can save your redactions and bring the window up at a later time. Once the redactions are completed, the documents are set up for Bates Numbering. Now the operator can sort the documents according to preference before applying the automated Bates Numbers.<br><br>The system will track the consecutive numbering throughout the course of the case, which could involve multiple discovery packages. After the operator completes a package, it is automatically saved to the InfoShare™ Documents record, so staff can see the original and the redacted documents “side by side”.<br><br>The feature also permits the operator to compile packages of electronic images and recordings, which can be downloaded on the discovery CD with document packages.<br><br>Now – the real- time saving features kick in! The Request for Discovery record permits the operator to select the package(s) for the set to be delivered and automatically creates the required index in the notice to defense attorney. Where applicable, it will also automatically create a bill to the defense attorney.<br><br>The module also tracks those charges to the defense attorney by the particular case, and all cases that he/she represents! Finally, with a push of a button, the operator can download the discovery package to a CD, or print the package. And for those multiple defendant cases – you already created the primary packages.<br><br>So it is just a matter of package selection and Request for Discovery entry to provide the same discovery to each defendant/ defense attorney (along with a bill, of course). Two state agencies and eight counties are presently using CSI’s InfoShare™ Discovery feature, and three counties are already lined up for deployment this year. So – join the “lineup” and discover the savings.

This annual conference, held this year in the nation’s capital on February 6-9, highlights the latest trends and best practices in technology across the United States of America. <br><br>The Regional Police Records Management Sharing Project in Camden County, powered by InfoShare™, was selected to be showcased at the event as a “best practice” project and the Camden County (NJ) Police Chiefs were asked to give a presentation. <br><br>Chief William Walsh, of the Bellmawr Police Department, represented the Camden County Chief’s Association and Executive Vice President Richard Norcross spoke on behalf of CSI Technology Group. <br><br>In addition to presenting the InfoShare™ Records Management Solution and its Global Search Engine, Push to Prosecutor and Push to Intelligence features, Walsh and Norcross highlighted the many success stories that have occurred as a result of the shared technology.<br><br> Chief Walsh shared how much his officers have come to count on the information they now have at their fingertips, much of which would likely be lost were it not for the shared RMS. Several cases, including burglaries and violent crimes, were discussed to show how pivotal a role seemingly minor, unrelated case information can play in crime resolution. Information such as a passenger in a car at the scene of an accident can lead to the apprehension of a violent fugitive, now that data can be shared and related across cases. <br><br>In addition to providing information on the InfoShare™ product line and success stories from the Camden County regional deployment, the presentation also covered these important topics: <br><br>● This is a true ‘shared service’ with real cost savings – The monetary savings are realized through having one hardware infrastructure and one system being shared by many departments, as opposed to every department having their own. In the case of Camden County, there are twenty-three departments representing over 600 officers and their twenty -three municipalities share the savings, instead of repeating the costs across each town. <br><br>● How to pay for a project such as this – Chief Walsh discussed shared service agreements, financing options such as low interest government loans and shared services grants. He stressed the importance of coming up with a fair and equitable co- sharing plan in advance of any purchases, so that there are no surprises down the road. <br><br>● Consolidation of solutions – The importance of consolidating solutions for CAD, Records Management, MDT Services, e-Ticket Service, Discovery, Prosecution and other case management services into a single manageable solution was discussed. Consolidation minimizes duplicative efforts and eliminates the need for costly and fragile interfaces between disparate vendors. National Sheriff’s Conference <br><br>● Memorandum of Understanding – It is imperative that a clear, concise and well thought out memorandum of understanding is executed among all of the Records Management System participants, spelling out the specifics of sharing data and what each department’s responsibilities are. The attendees from across the United States were very impressed with what was being accomplished by the Camden County Police Chief’s Association and their InfoShare™ Records Management System. “We at CSI Technology Group join the National Sheriff’s Association in saluting the Chief’s Association. Once again, we are reminded that the work we do at CSI goes beyond customer/client and that we are truly partners with the agencies that we serve,” remarks Rich Norcross on his partnership with Chief Walsh and their presentation to the National Sheriff’s Association."},{id:4,title:"THE FORFEITURE MODULE SAVES TIME – AND MONEY!",date:"3/2/2016",type:"news",src:"",body:"Are you spending days putting together the AG Quarterly Report of seized property and forfeitures? Can your attorneys easily access the status of a property item and your forfeiture filing? Can you quickly bring up the total cash seizures on hand? Let the Forfeiture Module do it for you!<br><br> With the InfoShare™ Forfeiture module, the AG Quarterly Report is produced in under 30 seconds – and each line has a “proving report” of all items in that total. Attorneys can see a forfeiture posted right in their e-Prosecution case record – with the latest status of all property. And you can run lists of property by type (cash, vehicles, other) with monetary values and totals. It even provides an automated report of all vehicles “in inventory” on December 31, which the auditors usually ask for. <br><br>Originally developed for Monmouth County, the module is now utilized by ten counties to track seizures, forfeiture filings, property returns to owners and distributions to law enforcement agencies. Over the years, CSI has incorporated suggestions from Forfeiture Units into the module, making their jobs easier. <br><br>The search features really help staff find answers quickly – for property owners, defense attorneys, and other members of the prosecutor’s staff. The data is also organized to help the staff meet filing deadlines and track court events for a particular case or the aggregate of cases, such as all events in a particular day or week for staff planning. <br><br>The reports feature includes itemized Distribution Reports, which can be run for each police department as forfeited currency and vehicles are distributed. This module is designed to save the Forfeiture Unit time in compiling reports, answering questions, inventory tracking and managing filings. <br><br>Have questions? Feel free to call our Sr. Vice President, Joe Britt, who has been supporting all our Forfeiture Unit clients since 2005, when we first launched the InfoShare™ Forfeiture module in Monmouth County."},{id:5,title:"InfoShare™ Screening Module: Helping Prosecutors’ Offices Deal with New Bail Reform Constraints",date:"3/28/2016",type:"news",src:"",body:"As county prosecutors are already aware, New Jersey passed a series of statutory amendments in late 2014 that have collectively become known as Bail Reform. These new measures take effect January 1, 2017 and will shorten the time frame prosecutors’ offices have to react to the risk assessment and condition of release when a person is arrested for a crime. <br><br>Early notification of an arrest will be key to the prosecution. At CSI, we want to help our New Jersey county prosecutors’ offices to deal effectively and efficiently with these new regulations. If the Prosecutor’s Office has installed the InfoShare™ CJP module, which contains a screening component to send arrest data and documents from the police department directly and electronically to the prosecutor’s office, they already have an automated pipeline for receiving the complaints the moment they are written. <br><br>Bail Reform, whose details can be found at N.J.S.A 2A:162- 15 et seq., now requires the court to complete a risk assessment within 48 hours of the defendant being committed to jail. If the prosecutor hasn’t weighed in within that 48 hour period, the court’s decision stands. New bail reform measures lean heavily towards the release of the defendant, unless clear and convincing evidence is provided that no set of release conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance in court. <br><br>The potential problem for the prosecutor is that the court is not required by statute to notify the prosecutor’s office that a decision is being made. CSI has been working with the courts to enhance the Screening module with an interface that would take defendant and charge data entered by police in the eCDR system and populate it directly into our Screening module, along with crucial documents. <br><br>This will shorten the time it takes for prosecutors to receive arrest information, while also eliminating potential errors caused by duplicate data entry. This puts the prosecutor’s office in a better position to know instantly when a new defendant is being charged, and gives them a chance to evaluate the bail reform implications of the defendant’s arrest. <br><br>Also, CSI has begun work with a customer to create a data exchange directly with the county jail. When this enhancement is in place, the Screening module will show when a new inmate has arrived at the jail’s intake unit for admissions processing, thereby triggering Bail Reform’s 48-hour clock. This data exchange focuses narrowly and directly on only the cases that are subject to Bail Reform risk assessment, and may include sending eCDR data to the jail. The goal is to provide an exchange of data among all of the institutional partners in the criminal justice seamlessly and automatically, initiating on the very first entry by the local police office making an arrest. <br><br>CSI Technology Group looks forward to the exciting new possibilities that Bail Reform will open in the realm of data sharing and we intend to continue to optimize ways to provide efficient and cost-effective solutions to our customers, even when laws and procedures change the way they are accustomed to doing business."},{id:6,title:"Cape May County Dispatchers Hear Both Sides of the Story In Their Annual Training",date:"4/4/2016",type:"news",src:"",body:"“It was difficult to sit through, but you could hear a pin drop in that room,” remarked Chief AnneMarie Ricco of the Cape May County Office of Emergency Management.

Her plans are approved by the New Jersey Office of Emergency Telecommunications Services and she works with the Cape May County Public Safety Training Academy to register the dispatchers and get it set up. <br><br>For this year’s training, Chief Ricco contracted John Zamrock, from Awareness Protective Consultants, who provided a course titled “The Telecommunications Operator Role in Active Shooter Events.” Mr. Zamrock drew heavily on the events of the Columbine shooting and provided videos and the recordings of the 911 calls that day. He stressed the importance of having effective emergency management plans and how to execute them. <br><br>In designing this year’s training program, Chief Ricco wanted the second half of the program to show a different perspective of an active shooter emergency, yet meet the requirements for a medical component of the training. Soon she realized she had the perfect presenter for this training right in her midst since last summer. <br><br>Since Cape May County’s implementation last year of their InfoShare™ CAD at the Office of Emergency Management and the RMS at the Cape May County Sheriff’s Office, CSI Executive VP Rich Norcross has made frequent visits to the agency. Chief Ricco knew Rich and she knew of the active shooter incident that happened in Haddon Heights back in 1995, but she didn’t put the two together. She didn’t realize that Rich was the police officer shot and critically wounded in that incident and that his younger brother, John, also a police officer ,was killed, along with Camden County Investigator Jack McLaughlin. When someone pointed out that connection to her, she decided to talk to Rich about fulfilling her agency’s training requirements. Rich Norcross frequently presents his story of that tragic incident to law enforcement agencies, especially in training environments. <br><br>While he claims it is often therapeutic for him, his presentations go a long way in helping to prepare others and teach them how to react if they find themselves in a similar situation. Norcross had an upcoming engagement to address DELTA (Development, Education, and Leadership Training Academy) at the Ocean County Police Academy, as part of a team of presenters that included the New Jersey State Police, the NJ Department of Criminal Justice, the Ocean, Somerset, Salem, Hudson and Monmouth County Prosecutors’ Offices and others. Rich’s topic was Concerns of Police Survivors. He invited Ricco to attend. <br><br>She recalls it was a gripping presentation and she realized it would be just the perfect complement to Zamrock’s training, which would focus on handling the emergency from behind the console and on the other side of the phone line from a frantic caller. Rich would be able to show them the emergency from the perspective of the police officers and the medical responders racing to the scene of an active shooter incident. “I thought it would be very valuable for them to understand what’s happening on that side of the call,” she says. <br><br>And so her plans were submitted to the State, approved and scheduled for early March. Zamrock and Norcross came on site, each presenting for four hours a day, satisfying the state requirements for annual in-service training. All dispatchers attended to maintain their certifications. While Zamrock reinforced their skills in their roles as dispatchers, they also got a taste of what it’s like for others involved in emergency response. <br><br>“He is an amazing speaker,” Ricco says of how Norcross unravels the story of that tragic day. “He is full of facts and speaks bluntly; but there is no way else to tell this story.” CSI was happy to loan out our Executive VP for Cape May’s annual training. We support our customers any way we can, and we admire Rich Norcross for turning a personal tragedy into a way to help others."},{id:7,title:"Warren County Regional RMS Expands Members and Data Sharing Capabilities",date:"4/27/2016",type:"news",src:"",body:"This past February, CSI welcomed the Phillipsburg, Pohatcong and Greenwich Township Police Departments to our rapidly growing InfoShare™ family. With these additional police departments on board, it now brings the Warren County Chiefs of Police Regional Records Management System (RMS) to a total of eight departments and an RMS user base of over 170 personnel. <br><br>These three municipalities are located in the western portion of Warren County, which borders Pennsylvania and covers a total of 27.5 square miles and serving a population of 24,000 residents. The Warren County Regional Records Management System (RMS) has built a tremendous capacity for police information sharing, at both the local level and state level, greatly increasing data access for each of its municipal departments. <br><br>Additionally, the Warren County Regional RMS will now also automatically send data to the New Jersey Data Exchange System (NJDEx,) through an interface provided by CSI. NJDEx is a mighty database in the anti-crime and anti-terrorism effort. It is hosted by the NJ Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness (NJOHSP), joining with the New Jersey State Police and the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) in their efforts to provide all NJ police departments with instant information to chase leads and protect citizens. NJDEx is also connected to the FBI’s N-DEx, which joins law enforcement agencies around the country in sharing data. <br><br>Warren County RMS’s interface to NJDEx was specifically developed for this project by CSI. It is as part of our on-going commitment to provide data to our law enforcement partners so they can more easily and effectively do their jobs to keep their citizens safe."},{id:8,title:"Portals Provide a New Way to Promote Services While SAVING RESOURCES",date:"5/12/2016",type:"news",src:"news-2016-0512.jpg",body:"CSI recognizes that portals have become one of the hottest new technologies of the Internet era and will likely continue to evolve significantly over the next few years. Portals provide a secure, user-friendly way of delivering information, tools and applications to the public, so CSI is now utilizing portal technology to provide our customers a cost-effective and efficient way to do business. <br><br>“CSI developed an outward-facing portal for Victim Witness services in response to our clients’ needs and requests,” explains CSI Account Manager Jill Imperial, who worked with the Atlantic County Victim Witness Advocacy Coordinators in testing this new InfoShare™ portal and populating it with the required letters and forms. “A major concern was to build the portal so that it was user-friendly and easily accessible.<br><br> The idea was to create one location for victims to have immediate information at their fingertips. The Victim Witness Portal does this by giving the advocates an easy way to communicate with the victims and witnesses, while tracking all correspondence and services provided. <br><br>Through the portal, victims and witnesses can access a variety of services and information from wherever they are, using their computer or their cell phone,” she says. <br><br>The InfoShare™ VW Portal is just one more way that CSI is working to help our customers save time, money and other resources, while still providing quality services to their constituency. <br><br>By utilizing technology and resources more effectively, the VW Portal will dramatically save resources in processing and distributing notices, providing regular services to victims and witnesses, eliminating duplicate work, gathering statistics and generating reports. Through the new VW Portal, you can: <br><br>● Receive and manage letters and notifications electronically <br><br>● Exchange secure messages with a V/W Advocate <br><br>● Access links to services and information <br><br>● Obtain and submit forms, including the Victim Impact Statement <br><br>● Submit images and documents <br><br>Once the victim creates a profile in the portal, all hard copy letter communication with the victim will cease, saving the agency resources and expenditures, such as postage, paper, envelopes and printing and storage-related charges, as well as time dedicated by advocates or support staff in the folding and stuffing of envelopes. All communication with the victim/ witness will then be pushed to their email or cellular telephone via texts. <br><br>Included with the portal is an integrated Victim Services Tab, which is built into the e-Prosecution, Juvenile, Investigation and DV Family modules and is specifically designed in accordance with the new 2016 federal guidelines. All correspondence, including post-conviction letters, can be generated and uploaded directly to each case file. Designed into the portal and the integrated Victim Services Tab is a statewide statistical gathering solution, which includes the automatic generation of the SubGrantee Data Report.<br><br> “The first VW portal went live in Atlantic County under the direction of Victim Witness Coordinator Jacqueline Simonson, on March 7,” reports Imperial, adding, “a great deal of time and energy was put into this project by Jackie and her staff.”<br><br>The new VW Portal and the integrated Victim Services Tab is designed to serve the needs of all twenty-one county prosecutors’ offices and the Attorney General’s Office. Contact CSI if you would like more information on how this new portal technology can save resources and improve services for your agency."},{id:9,title:"Managing Your Confidential Sources Is Secure and Complete with the InfoShare™ Confidential Informant Module",date:"5/30/2016",type:"news",src:"",body:"Most serving in law enforcement know how integral the use of confidential sources can be to solve a case. But it often comes with the very necessary task of keeping track of all of the details involved with locating, using and managing them. It can sometimes become very time consuming and difficult to keep track of all of these details. Keeping notes locked up in your drawer or a safe may keep the informant’s identity private, but will not help you or others on your force track the informants’ assignments, payments or specialties.<br><br> CSI’s Confidential Informant module was designed to help law enforcement control and monitor all confidential sources. It has a user friendly interface to manually input a confidential source or add the source through a master name search. <br><br>The user can then complete a very thorough evaluation of the confidential source, including data base checks and payment history. The module contains a Confidential Source Contact Log tab, where any contact with the confidential source is recorded. From this tab, the user can add payment and general contact information. Another feature under this tab is the Intelligence Note, where the officer can record intelligence information. Then, with a click of a button, this information will be pushed to the InfoShare™ Intelligence module, eliminating duplication of work and the problems that can sometimes cause. There is also a documents tab with built-in templates housing agency forms. When generated, these are pre-populated with information from the database. These documents can then be printed out, signed and rescanned into the system. The Confidential Informant module also provides mapping to track the locations of the sources. This can be a useful tool when a crime or incident happens. A user with proper permissions can very quickly map the sources and see if there may be a source available in the area of the crime. <br><br>Also, from the home page, the user can track their primary, secondary, active and non-active confidential sources right from their inboxes. The module uses permissions that are set up to control who can see confidential sources. The Confidential Informant module is a one stop shop to approve, control, manage, and track all of your agency’s confidential sources. <br><br>Give CSI a call to see how this module will let your officers utilize your sources effectively, spending more time on solving crimes and less on the details involved with tracking confidential informants."},{id:10,title:"Coming to a Prosecutor’s Office Near You: Bail Reform and Budget Caps",date:"6/13/2016",type:"news",src:"",body:"By now, government agencies are used to being asked to do more with less, but it sure doesn’t make it any easier to accomplish their missions. This year, our prosecutors’ offices are faced with two new legislative measures, one that impacts how they operate in detaining defendants upon arrest, and the other affecting the amount of money they can spend on their operations. Since InfoShare™ is being used by all 21 New Jersey prosecutors’ offices, we want to help these clients make the most of their funds, as well as more efficiently operate within the new measures. The two new initiatives that are impacting the prosecutors’ offices are the bail reform measures and the new budget cap on county government. The cap is nothing new to municipalities; these local agencies have felt the pinch for several years now.<br><br> But now these restrictions are also being applied at the county level. That, combined with the quicker turnaround time for responding to bail assessments by the court, will impose change on the county prosecutors beginning in 2017. <br><br>As detailed in the page 4 article on Bail Reform and the InfoShare™ Screening (CJP) module, the new bail measures reduce the time the prosecutor has to respond to bail recommendations set by the court. In addition to this, the court is not required to notify the Prosecutor when they are doing a risk assessment. However, installing the InfoShare ™ Screening module will allow the prosecutor’s office to receive the arrest documents immediately and directly from the local police departments. It also provides a cost savings by eliminating the need to manually travel to the police departments to collect arrest documents, and in the storage of those documents. The screening module also increases the capacity for efficient and cost effective data sharing among criminal justice agencies. For more information on the impact of using the Screening Module under the new Bail Reform measures, please turn to page 4. <br><br>Also, CSI now offers the prosecutors’ offices a complete Victim Witness portal that will dramatically save resources in processing and distributing notices and providing services to victims. Partnering with the Atlantic County Prosecutor’s Office in the development and testing of this new product, CSI now offers all counties the ability to deploy this full- service portal for gathering Victim/Witness information, generating required letters and notices and providing links to services to the victims via a portal that can be accessed from any computer or smart device. This will not only increase accuracy and communication between the Victim/Witness Services Unit and the victim/witness, but the module seamlessly integrates with the Infoshare™ e-Prosecution module, saving work as well as costs, with the elimination of redundant data entry, postage, paper and printing charges. These costs can be significant. Please see the article starting on page 2 that details the features and benefits of the new Victim/Witness portal.<br><br> Thirdly, we would like to emphasize the importance of the InfoShare™ Forfeiture module as a significant time-saving resource for the tracking and reporting of forfeited property. Prosecutors’ offices can use these funds for operational improvements (including purchasing the Forfeiture module!) The Forfeiture module tracks all properties seized, according to the Attorney General’s guidelines, and generates the necessary reports. We also have a detailed article on the Forfeiture module in this issue (page 5), so please check that out and consider it for tracking forfeitures for your county. <br><br>CSI would like to support you through these changes and provide you the technology you need to realize long term savings and efficiency for your agency. We provide a robust product line with modules that are seamlessly integrated to support your work while saving you time and money. We strive to stay ahead of legislative and operational changes that affect you and consistently seek your input and suggestions to be aware of and support your changing needs. <br><br>Contact your account manager or our office for more information or a demo of any of our resource-saving InfoShare ™modules."},{id:11,title:"InfoShare™ Dual Authentication Provides Twice the Security to Protect Your Data!",date:"7/8/2016",type:"news",src:"",body:"When you get home from work today and you unlock your door with your key, you have used dual authentication. When you go to the ATM to grab some cash before going out to dinner, you will insert your card in the reader and then be required to enter your PIN to get your money. That, too, is an exercise in dual authentication. <br><br>You may have been hearing lately about using dual authentication as a way to strengthen cybersecurity and protect data, but the concept really isn’t new, as it isn’t much different than the actions illustrated above. You’ve been doing it most of your life, and it has been around for ages. It pairs something you have with something you know. Unlocking your door requires you have the proper key for your door and you know exactly where that door is. In banking, dual factor authentication has been in existence since the advent of the ATM (MAC, for our older readers). You have your ATM card and you know your PIN; you must have both items to gain entry to your account. <br><br>CSI Technology Group takes security and the safeguarding of your data very seriously. We understand the importance to law enforcement agencies of safeguarding CJIS information; that it stands near the top of the list in security ranking, right underneath operational security, which impacts officer safety. <br><br>CSI has developed dual authentication for our InfoShare™ product line, and it meets the requirements of the New Jersey State Police and the FBI security regulations. For our New Jersey agencies that store, even on a temporary basis, Computerized Criminal History (CCH) information in their InfoShare™ system, adopting this dual factor authentication will be critical for continued compliance with the CJIS regulations. <br><br>CSI offers the following two versions of dual factor authentication for your agency to choose from: <br><br>One Time Authorization Code (OTAC)Transmission – <br><br>With this option, the InfoShare™ account holder will enter their user name, password and a one-time authorization code that is transmitted to an InfoShare™ registered cell phone or e-mail address. This OTAC is only good for a predetermined period of time<br><br> Token – <br><br>Using the token option, an agency provides to CSI an external USB hard drive (also known as a “thumb drive” or “flash drive”) and we will implant an authorization token onto that device. Then the InfoShare™ account holder will enter their user name and password while the thumb drive is plugged into their device. This option is very popular with agencies that have other devices that require this type of authentication, such as certain brands of in-car cameras and ALPR Readers.<br><br> The InfoShare™ dual authentication application provides flexibility for your agency’s security plan, allowing your administrator to specify what type of credentials are required for which use, and providing the administrator with the ability to mix the authentication type. For example, a department can allow computers located in the department (i.e., a secured location) to be “whitelisted” from this policy, that is, accessed without any dual authentication requirement. This can be configured for all workstations in the agency, or just designated computers, such as the computer on the Chief of Police’s desk, which is located in a locked office. For MDT use, the department can specify that the user would have to use a USB drive token. The department could allow others to connect via an emailed PIN or secondary password which would be entered to confirm the identity of the user. <br><br>A CSI Technology Group representative can provide guidance on determining best practices for your agency in establishing your security plan. If you are interested in acquiring the Dual Factor Authentication application for your InfoShare™ System, please contact your CSI Technology Group representative or Mike Trahey at (732) 346-0200 for more details."},{id:12,title:"CSI Announces New InfoShare™ Consumer Affairs Module",date:"7/19/2016",type:"news",src:"",body:"A shady home improvement contractor in Burlington County, a fraudulent car dealer in Bergen County, a bogus investment fund management company in Hudson County……examples of consumer fraud happen all over New Jersey. <br><br>The New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs and the twenty-one county offices of consumer affairs protect NJ consumers from the wily practices of fraudulent businesses. These agencies enforce laws and handle and investigate complaints dealing with scams involving product liability, privacy rights, unfair business practices, fraud, misrepresentation, and other consumer/business interactions.

Two of our newest staff members have actually walked many miles in our customers’ shoes, and we would like to introduce you to them! <br><br>Kim Petty has law enforcement in her blood. Her dad served as a police officer, finishing his career as a Major at the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office (SCPO), and her brother is a corrections officer. Kim came to CSI in August, 2015, after a 27- year career in law enforcement herself. She started in 1988 as a dispatcher for the Phillipsburg Police Department. After serving 2 years there, she went on to join the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office. <br><br>Kim began her SCPO career in the Intelligence Unit, where she analyzed data and compiled reports to support narcotics operations. She also trained and supervised employees on various software and went on to become a systems manager for the SCPO. In this capacity, she managed and planned the various stages of implementation for InfoShare™ products and trained staff on the use of the modules. She was responsible for developing and implementing policy and procedures for data control and appraising the effectiveness of office systems and practices the agency used to meet both their short and long-term goals. She found InfoShare ™ was an integral tool to help investigators and case managers work efficiently and effectively, and when it was time to retire from public service, she found an opportunity at CSI to continue to help prosecutors’ offices utilize InfoShare™ to its fullest capacity. <br><br>“The experience I obtained from 25 years in working at the Prosecutor’s Office has afforded me the experience and motivation to innovate new ideas and overcome obstacles,” reflects Kim. Her solid working experience with InfoShare™ coupled with her knowledge of the work and goals of prosecutors’ offices staff make her a perfect fit for our account management staff and a strong ally to our customers. <br><br>This past May, CSI welcomed Gerry Dezenzo, another seasoned law enforcement professional, to our team of account managers. Gerry served almost 30 years as an investigator at the Hudson County Prosecutor’s Office (HCPO). As a member of the Narcotics Task Force, he developed a proficiency in the area of lawful intercepts, applying his knowledge as a technical investigator. <br><br>Gerry moved through the ranks at HCPO, being promoted from Sergeant to Lieutenant and retiring as Captain of Detectives. Besides detective work, his tenure at HCPO included being assigned as Commander of the Computer and Technical Services Section. “The technical responsibility was exciting, as I was responsible for ushering in the era of digital photography to the Prosecutor’s Office. Complying with the NJ Supreme Court ruling requiring video recordation of certain crimes, document scanning and preservation, we designed and deployed a wireless infrastructure in Hudson County to support law enforcement efforts. We advanced from analog to digital telephone interception and expanded data intercept capabilities to support our investigations.”<br><br> With his strong background in both investigative police work and technology, Gerry understands the work of our law enforcement clients and intimately knows their needs and what technical solutions will optimize the work they do every day. Knowing his way around the business, he helps them exploit all the features of InfoShare™ in their daily work. <br><br>CSI is happy to have Kim and Gerry as members of our account management team. We strive to staff our account management team with subject matter experts and those who understand the requirements of our clients’ business. This helps us build products that meet their needs, as well as provide superior technical support.

Each county also has its own department for county oversight of this critical responsibility to its citizens. CSI Technology Group focuses on creating software to protect citizens.<br><br> We serve clients in every county of New Jersey as well as several state regulatory agencies, and we think it is very important to provide a product to assist agencies in the monitoring and enforcement of weights and measures laws. To this end, we have developed the InfoShare™ Weights and Measures Enforcement Case Management System.<br><br> This powerful application provides comprehensive case management of all investigations and complaints dealing with weights and measures regulations, as well as regular monitoring of businesses providing measurable products and services. The system can be configured specifically for your agency, to track complaints and inspections according to your workflow and with customization of tables and codes, as needed. As with all of our applications, we make it easy to maintain code tables to accommodate changes in regulations.<br><br> The InfoShare™ Weights and Measures system is packed with robust functionality and easy to use features. Information on local businesses that includes locations and contacts, information on past inspections or complaints is kept at your fingertips with ticklers that let you know when inspections are due. You can also easily access commercial device data, including location, manufacturer and model. It has extensive capabilities to search on data stored in the database and to generate standard reports on inspection results, company information and complaints. You can also create custom reports on specific data you need at any time, and it comes with templates so you can easily produce notices or other documents that are automatically populated with case data.<br><br> The system also has an optional mobile component so you can take your operation to the field on your iPad, or other mobile device. Right from the inspection or investigation location, you can enter the commodity name and location, scan the UPC on the shelf, scan and produce barcodes, record the shelf price, take photos and, with the push of a button, upload it all to the case management system. You will have access to a scanner audit form and other customized field reports and the ability to print them on the spot with a mobile printer.<br><br> The system also helps the businesses your agency monitors by providing automated notifications to them so they remain in compliance with regulated standards. It produces certifications of successful inspections, providing proof of compliance.<br><br> Let’s get back to the magnitude of the impact of accurately measured services and products. According to TradingEconomics.com, a global economics research group that utilizes sources such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the US GDP was worth $17,947 billion dollars last year, representing nearly 30% of the world’s economy.

The prosecutor must move for detention in almost all cases involving first and second degree crimes and show by clear and convincing evidence that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions, or combination thereof will ensure the defendant’s appearance in court, the safety of the community, and that the defendant will not obstruct the criminal justice process.<br><br> “CSI is working closely with our prosecutor’s office customers to help them take maximum advantage of Infoshare™’s line of products at the initial stages of the most serious criminal prosecutions,” states CSI VP Josh Ottenberg, an attorney who served as an assistant prosecutor in Camden County before joining CSI.<br><br> “InfoShare™’s CJP/ Screening tools make available all the crucial information about a defendant and his new charges to screening attorneys, either at the push of a button from an InfoShare™ police RMS system, or after a simple upload procedure. This facilitates the ability of the prosecutor to make an informed decision about whether to move for pre-trial detention or allow the court to structure the conditions of the defendant’s release. In addition, by making it easy for the local police to provide the screening prosecutors with more of the related case documents, the prosecutor has a better chance to muster sufficient evidence without calling vulnerable witnesses to the stand in the preliminary stages of an investigation,” Ottenberg explains.<br><br> InfoShare™ helps the prosecutor’s office assemble and distribute the documentation necessary to successfully handle a detention hearing. Having made the decision to move for detention, the prosecutor must then muster witnesses and/or provide discovery to the courts and defense attorney in preparation for the hearing. InfoShare™’s eDiscovery products enable the prosecutor to package, redact and Bates stamp any group of documents in a case that has been given a Promis/Gavel number. The ability to push out documents to the other players in the criminal justice system is of particular importance in an environment where the risk assessment instrument that is to be the court’s principle guide in making the release decisions is intentionally blind when it comes to assessing the risk that the defendant will obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. N.J.S 2A: 162-25, Section 11 b (1) states that “[t]he risk assessment instrument shall not be required to include factors specifically pertaining to the risk for obstructing or attempting to obstruct the criminal justice process.” Prosecutors are completely on their own when it comes to mustering this crucial evidence needed to convince the court to detain a defendant.<br><br> As your organizations prepares to adjust for new bail reform legislation, call CSI so we can show you how InfoShare™’s Intelligence module, Fugitive module, Master Name Index and a host of other tools brings crucial information about the defendant within the reach of the prosecutor, helping him or her meet the burden of proof, and get the information into the hands of the court and defense.<br><br><div class='text-sm-center'><img src='../img/news/news-2016-1011-1.png'></div>"},{id:19,title:"InfoFire: Next Generation Fire Reporting Management",date:"10/25/2016",type:"news",src:"",body:"CSI Technology Group continues to tackle new challenges and enter new arenas in the public safety sector.

The school year has just begun, and as parents drop their children off at school or watch as their bus pulls away, they should be able to feel that their kids will be safe and secure while in the classroom. But as we know too well, we are now living in a time of heightened alert, when world, national, corporate, and individual security has become an all too common concern. And, unfortunately, we have seen the sanctity of our schools also become a place where terrorist attacks, bomb threats and even shootings by fellow classmates are increasing at an alarming rate.<br><br> Practicing security and lockdown drills has become a part of the regular curriculum at many schools throughout our country. The New Jersey School Security Task Force, in their report issued last summer, suggested ongoing training in many formats, conducted collaboratively by schools and professional emergency responders, be carried out and be required for all school personnel.<br><br> Also in their report, the Task Force recommends the use of smartphone devices to send an immediate alert to police and for two-way communication during an emergency. In response to these concerns and their resulting school safety initiatives, CSI has developed Info-Alert!, a special module designed to reside on smartphones and support the communication of both emergency and administrative matters in our schools throughout the country.<br><br> InfoAlert! is a modern smart device application that supports today’s school safety initiatives and promotes rapid communication for emergency alerts and other notifications. From a school closing to an active shooter, InfoAlert! provides your school administration with the ability to get the right information to the right people FAST!<br><br> Designed especially for school safety and administration, some of the special features built into InfoAlert! include:<br><br> ● The ability to notify and alert who you must when you must. You can even set up pre-defined distribution lists, ready for quick notifications to target audiences at any time.<br><br> ● You can send select notifications to staff, students and even other schools. <br><br>● You can send quick, silent alerts to public safety authorities with the push of a button. The silent communication feature facilitates the ability to send and receive communication and instructions in times of emergency and lock-downs.<br><br> ● Provides an immediate warning and notification capability among school administrators, teachers and students.<br><br> ● Embedded with GPS technology: When you notify police, they automatically know your location.<br><br> ● Easily attach photos and videos to your message.<br><br> ● Fully integrates with police RMS and CAD for immediate response dispatch and access to school security plans.<br><br> When a parent hears the dreaded news that an incident has occurred at their child’s school, usually the first inclination is to rush to the site and remove their child. However, as reported in NJ.com this past January, parents are advised not to self-deploy to the school scene. Having parents on the scene causes police to have to split their resources, and perform crowd control, rather than focusing on containing the perpetrator and protecting and aiding the students. Patrick Kissane, executive director of the New Jersey Association of School Resource Officers, told NJ.com that “Crowds of parents or media at the site of a real event can be the difference between casualties living or dying.” He advises that communication is key, as well as knowing the school’s emergency plan. InfoAlert! supports parent notifications and updates, and is configured to the school’s emergency plans. It can keep parents informed and lets them know what they should do.<br><br> The ability to send and receive notifications, and access all of the safety features listed above, are available on something almost every person in the school keeps with them constantly, their smart phone. With InfoAlert!, putting an emergency response into action is just a click away!<br><br> In combination with excellent, repetitive training and a well thought out plan of action, InfoAlert! is a key component to your school’s action plan. Its timely technology seamlessly integrates with all aspects of your school safety plan, working to keep our children safe at school so they can continue to learn in a healthy, stable environment. That is CSI’s goal, as we continue our partnership with state, county and municipal government.

Since the implementation of CSI’s InfoCAD and RMS version 3.0, the officers of the East Rutherford Police Department have welcomed the software with open arms and minds. Long overdue for a CAD/RMS and mobile upgrade, ERPD explored several options in 2018 and decided upon CSI’s CAD/RMS solution, along with the MDT application and several modules, including the newly designed Personnel Module.<br><br><img src='../img/news/news-2018-0209-1.jpg'/><br><br>While new technology and the process of learning the nuances of a different software product might be daunting for some, the officers and clerks of the East Rutherford Police Department have taken to CSI’s InfoShare CAD/RMS system like seasoned veterans, and have not looked back. Police Chief Dennis Rivelli and Captain Phillip Taormina lead the way and have been instrumental in exploring the system and its capabilities to suit their needs. Their ambition to utilize all that the CAD Center and RMS have to offer has filtered down among the rank and file. Chief Rivelli and Capt. Taormina have contributed greatly to the experience and relationship with CSI, and understand that the software and needs of police are ever evolving and adaptable. According to Capt. Taormina, “The simplicity of the system and having all the state reports in one place is a huge hit among the officers.”<br><br> The CSI interactions with the supervisors in the Dispatch Center and the inquiries of the officers utilizing the MDT software in the police vehicles have been extremely positive. The feedback from the entire department has shown that they have been working hard in the system to discover all its capabilities.<br><br>While the InfoShare system is still fairly new to them, the integration of the CAD Center and MDT to the RMS has already proven invaluable in saving the officers’ time when running parties in the CAD and having the party information readily available for their reports in the RMS.  This has been especially helpful for motor vehicle crash reports. The East Rutherford Police Department handles approximately 1,700 calls for service per month, while an average of sixty (60) of those calls are motor vehicle crashes.<br><br><img src='../img/news/news-2018-0209-2.jpg'/><br><br>The Permits & Licenses Module is also regularly utilized by the Detectives and Clerical staff.  All firearms applications are now being handled in the module and the ease of the system has resulted in a smoother workflow from the time of application to the issuance or denial of the permits.<br><br>All in all, the transition to the InfoShare CAD/RMS and MDT systems has been an extremely positive one for the East Rutherford Police Department.  Their feedback and suggestions are always professional and insightful as their knowledge of the software becomes greater with each work day.  CSI wishes to congratulate Chief Rivelli and his department for selecting InfoShare and for allowing CSI to move them into the future of computer software for law enforcement!"},{id:3,title:"InfoShare RMS Clery Component",date:"3/24/2018",type:"news",src:"news-2018-0324.jpg",body:"In 1986, Jeanne Clery, a freshman and student athlete at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania  was sexually assaulted and murdered inside of her campus dorm room by another student of this university.  During this point in time, it was common that schools did not advised students of the numerous violet crimes that occurred on college campuses, which was the case for the Clery Family.<br><br> In honor of their daughter, Howard and Connie Clery initiated a crusade to change this practice and through a non-profit organization, Security On Campus, sought to make college campuses safer by alerting students and parents as to the violence occurring on college campuses and surrounding areas.  This was the start of a movement, which was recognized by Congress and eventually signed into law as the “The Campus Security Act”.  In 1988, Congress renamed The Campus Security Act  “The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Police and Campus Crime Statistics Act” more commonly known as the Clery Act.<br><br>The Clery Act is a mandate that requires all post-secondary educational institutions, to prepare and publish an Annual Security Reports and to make timely warnings of threats to the college community and its students.  Collection of this information for college security can be a complex task considering the importance of protecting our students.  CSI Technology understands the strong message communicated by Howard and Connie Clery and has developed a Records Management System (InfoShare RMS) that focuses on the collecting valuable crime information that will aid in keeping Police and campus security departments in touch with the current trends in crime.  This will enable these agencies to readily provide this important information to the students they serve.<br><br>The InfoShare RMS Clery Component aids Police and Security departments to build Annual Security Reports and Daily Crime Logs in an electronic format.  CSI’s InfoShare platform accommodates institutions that have a private campus police department and if the institution is served by a state local or county police agency.  CSI’s technology experts will work with the University’s Information Technology Department in posting this information to a public facing website in near real-time. In today’s social media environment, CSI helps the University create up- to- date crime logs so that this information can be presented to students on mobile devices as they move through their campus life.<br><br>CSI’s InfoShare RMS Clery Component has admistrative tools that produce statistical reports based upon the Federal Clery Crime standards; residence hall and location based crime reports and geo- based reports, which extend the college campus to areas frequented by students.<br><br>CSI is using the impetus created by the Howard and Connie Clery to provide Law Enforcement the ability to provide families the information necessary to protect their children at when they are ready to make the all-important decision on which college to attend."},{id:4,title:"The InfoShare Child Advocacy Center Module",date:"5/3/2018",type:"news",src:"",body:"<h3 class='mb-3'>Designed to Accurately and Efficiently Record the Multidisciplinary Response to Child Abuse Investigations</h3>Child Advocacy Centers (CAC) provide a neutral environment focused on child victims where they can feel safe and comfortable while multidisciplinary teams comprised of dedicated professionals work together to investigate the crime and deliver comprehensive services and resources to the victims and their families.  Recognizing the vital role CACs play in the communities they serve by reducing the impact of abuse and minimizing secondary trauma to child victims, several New Jersey prosecutor’s offices now operate county-based CACs.<br><br> Designed in close collaboration with subject matter experts at the Camden County Prosecutor’s Office, the first Prosecutor’s Office in the State of New Jersey to launch the new module, InfoShare’s Child Advocacy Center module provides a database specific to the documentation and reporting requirements of the CAC.  CAC staff are notified at the onset of the Detective’s investigation through the CAC sub-module, an exclusive feature of the Child Advocacy Center module.  This sub-module integrates with the Investigation module and allows the investigator to simultaneously initiate a CAC case and notify CAC personnel of the child abuse investigation.  The data entered in the sub-module is automatically reproduced in the dedicated module’s CAC case, saving the staff’s valuable time and reducing duplicative efforts.

The InfoShare CAC Module can help CACs reach and maintain NCA accreditation by providing a database to comply with the NCA’s accreditation standard for case tracking, an essential and time-consuming a task for a CAC.  The accreditation standard requires the CAC to track and retrieve NCA statistical information, all of which is efficiently maintained in the CAC module.<br><br>Additionally, timely and accurate statistical reporting is an equally important function of the Child Advocacy Center and becomes much easier with the inclusion of the CAC module.  Child Advocacy Centers are required to report their collaborative work biannually to the National Children’s Alliance (NCA).  Data recorded in the CAC module can be exported to the NCA Statistical Report, which is built into the module.  Furthermore, victim services recorded in the CAC module are tabulated in the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Report."},{id:5,title:"CSI InfoShare Personnel Module",date:"7/16/2018",type:"news",src:"",body:"CSI InfoShare personnel module provids a total solution for your agencies scheduling, training, firearms qualifications and inventory management.<br><br>The scheduling component is a powerful and flexible scheduling tool with capabilities that fit the needs of any size agency.

The InfoShare application already includes the pertinent case and unit assignment information, defendant information and disposition/sentence results, and a listing of all documents that have been entered into the case file, including Discovery documents produced in the system.<br><br> The DCJ InfoShare application was enhanced with a number of new functionalities and inboxes for the routing process.<br><br> 1. Users mark a closed case record in InfoShare ready for storage, apply the statutory retention date, classify the type of case for storage section and identify the pick-up location.<br> 2. Case files can be prepared individually or boxed with other cases with the same retention date year.  The feature permits the user to place multiple cases in one box or one case in multiple boxes – to match the physical boxed files.<br>3. The system produces bar codes on labels to affix to case folders and/or to the box(es).<br>4. The case file or box listings post to the Custodian’s Pending Pick-up inbox, identifying the Unit and place of pick-up.<br>5. Staff members who send cases/boxes to storage also have inboxes showing their pending pick-up list, which remains listed until the case/boxes are picked-up.<br><br>In order to track the transportation, delivery and storage assignment of boxes, a separate module was designed and deployed for the warehouse custodian staff.   The Custodian module provides records and functionality to:<br><br> 1. Graphically compose the design of storage facilities in rows, cabinets, shelves that reflect the physical warehouse, and set up a letter/number scheme to mark each storage unit (floor mapping feature).<br>2. List all boxes that are ready for pick-up and the offices where they are located, and a check off function when delivered to the warehouse.<br>3. List all boxes received with identifiable retention dates.  Custodian can verify the receipt of the box by bar code scan or check off on a listing record. (The custodian can place individual case files in boxes already stored or create new boxes for a set of these cases.)<br>4. Operate a view of the floor plan to readily identify sections by retention year and space available in the cabinets, and then click the box listing to store it in the selected cabinet/shelf.<br>6. Automatically updates the InfoShare case record with storage location so Unit staff will know just where it is stored in the event they need to retrieve it in the future.<br>7. Easily retrieve the file/box from storage, so the custodian can hold the space and return file to the unit, while automatically creating a “file on loan” list.<br><br><h3>Major Advantages of the Warehouse Module</h3><br><br>1. Case file is tracked from moment of marking “ready for storage” to storage shelf placement with postings on the InfoShare case records as well as in the Custodian module.<br>2. Ability to graphically replicate the physical storage room set up to store, look-up placement or remove case files/boxes.<br>3. Convenient to set-up sections for restricted files such as expungements, wire taps, Internal Affairs, etc.<br>4. Easy to identify case numbers assigned to box by search and location display, and “hover” over graphical cabinet/shelf for case lists.<br>5. Quick search to list all boxes, and their location, within a retention/destruction date range, and to “destroy” selected boxes in a batch.

The fundamental concept is simple, once the video is uploaded into a dedicated media server environment,  the video is available for investigation and discovery purposes without ever having to copy video again. While InfoVideo can be installed on local servers, CSI is also recommending utilizing AWS cloud services. AWS provides flexible resources that can make the sometimes resource intensive job of uploading, storage and distribution of audio and video files easier. <br><br> Local police users install and use the InfoVideo application locally. Once the client application is installed, local users can, if they choose, edit down the larger dash-can or body-cam videos to the relevant stop or incident that is related to the case that is going to the prosecutor’s office.  The smaller edited video can then be uploaded into the media server. When the upload is complete, a link to the video is placed in the Investigations or eProsecutions case in the prosecutor’s main application in the documents tab. Once the video is resident on the media server, the prosecutor’s office can also make additional small videos and take screenshots for investigative and prosecution purposes by using a basic video editing tool in the View Documents page accessed through the documents tab.<br><br>The original video and any related videos can then be “added” to a standard InfoShare eDiscovery package as a media file. As indicated earlier, what is actually added is a link to the video on the media server. This link is included in the documents package sent to the eDiscovery Portal. From there, the defense attorney can download the video to examine and share with his or her client. CSI has also enhanced the download process for the defense attorneys who use the eDiscovery Portal by creating a download tool that makes it easier for the defense attorney to view and download the video for their file.<br><br><img src='../img/news/news-2018-1206-1.jpg'/>"}]},a52c:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/kim.176c83db.jpg"},a537:function(e,t,a){},a78c:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/back.05c66350.svg"},a956:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/InfoRecording_thumb.c87ac05a.jpg"},aa61:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/mail.b84d71d1.svg"},ab29:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/new_york.6bad73fa.png"},abc6:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/frank.ae86be61.png"},ac3e:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/icon-download.9353ac97.svg"},ad77:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/konard.472e4597.png"},adef:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/support.4a4e3786.jpg"},b265:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/josh.3119f0b6.png"},b2dd:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/peter.a8807827.jpg"},b2e2:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/value-04.fdba913d.svg"},b3c6:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/InfoScheduler_thumb.bb25ed1e.jpg"},b544:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/kim.44c934ea.png"},b6e0:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/InfoTown_thumb.4fc07386.jpg"},b6e5:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/p-rolmes.23b9f3fc.svg"},b778:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/menu.559ded7d.svg"},b7a2:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/InfoDash_thumb.441f2e10.jpg"},b7bb:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/john-p.5bf99cb7.jpg"},ba952:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/p-infoalert.acc92d79.svg"},bb97:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/history-2018.487e95cf.jpg"},bbcd:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/oklahoma.d89b0b79.png"},bc9e:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/RMS_thumb.c6900296.jpg"},be33:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/infoalert.fa57f752.jpg"},bfaa:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/vwportal.4c95a22c.jpg"},c079:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/eTicket_content.6c808ad8.png"},c633:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/arrow-left.1e0992e3.svg"},c6ac:function(e){e.exports=[{id:1,title:"The InfoShare™ Personnel Module: A Total Solution For Agency HR Administration",date:"1/26/2017",type:"news",src:"",body:"CSI Technology Group is proud to announce the release of the InfoShare™ Personnel Module, a robust, total solution for your agency’s HR management needs. A powerful system with submodules for scheduling and policy compliance, the InfoShare™ Personnel Module has been designed to allow your agency to effectively manage and document your scheduling, training, and policy and procedure activities. Employee time, training requests, document tracking (with electronic signatures, if needed) and other HR functions are all handled. All components are user -friendly and can be configured to your needs with our built-in support file management system. No matter the size of your organization, this new total HR solution will meet your requirements and allow you to move to a paperless environment.<br><br> Equipment and inventory can be administratively managed in the InfoShare™ Personnel Module, providing for inventory intake and the recordation of equipment assigned. A convenient equipment and inventory tool allows you to set alerts for equipment such as police vests and ammunition, which have expiration dates assigned to them, and will prompt the Quarter Master to place a new order.<br><br> The ability to document, manage, and schedule training is very important to most organizations and often laden with details and many levels of approval. The training component within the InfoShare™ Personnel module, configured to your agency’s workflow and requirements, facilitates this entire process. It allows for administrative batch training entry or individual requests and tracks the request through your agency’s approval chain. Once a training request is administratively assigned or approved, the requestor receives a training email and inbox notification. Training is tracked all the way to the final approval and is reflected in the agency’s scheduling calendar.<br><br> InfoScheduler is the optional scheduling submodule that ties into the other modules. It provides the ability to not only keep organized work schedules for any of your agency’s shifts, but also has layers which cover overtime, comp time, vacation and training assignments and posts assignments which need to be tracked on a daily, weekly monthly and yearly basis. InfoScheduler allows users to easily submit leave, overtime, comp-time and training requests, while your department’s approval workflow is configured and maintained electronically.<br><br> InfoP&P is the HR module’s optional document management submodule. InfoP&P allows your department to create, approve and disseminate documents, as well as verify and review compliance, all electronically. All active policies and procedure remain in the user’s active inbox for easy access. If a policy or procedure is updated, the old version is archived for later review when necessary. It supports police department national and state accreditation, providing the means to create and maintain all required policies and procedures, integrates with the police department’s RMS and electronically files all mandatory proof documents. “The integration with the RMS affords the accreditation manager the ability to locate proof reports within the RMS application and electronically attach them to the appropriate proof folder,” explains CSI Account Manager Matt Edwards. “This saves your accreditation managers an incredible amount of time because they don’t need to track down the required proofs. This is a very powerful tool which is changing how the very important accreditation process is being managed.”<br><br> CSI is leading the way in providing complete solutions that streamline the process of electronic document management for every aspect of law enforcement and other government services. Besides the extended features it provides, it can also integrate with the InfoShare™ Internal Affairs module and our optional Time Keeping Kiosk.

This specialized suite of softwareand services was designed to aid victim witness units, statewide, with their heavy workload, leaving them to focus more of their attention on other areas of victim support. Throughout this effort, many at CSI have formed a very direct, personal connection to these units and have grown to appreciate the depth of the victim services provided by these hard-working and dedicated teams within each county and at the NJ Division of Criminal Justice (DCJ). So, the development and launch of this product line has special meaning for CSI.<br><br> Here is a brief look at some of the features you can expect with the Victim Witness Suite:<br><br> ● Automated / Customizable Victim Letters – A very time-consuming task for the Victim Witness Units is the amount of letters that need to be generated for victims of cases, based on many courts events and their outcomes. This includes letters for victims in the adult, juvenile, investigations, and domestic violence modules. This feature now automates the letters based on the court events, whether the event is generated by the courts' computer systems or if they are manually entered court case events. “We have been working with each county, customizing their letters along with the triggers that should generate the letters. Once the letters generate and are reviewed, the letters will automatically populate to their cases, saving staff time because the documents do not have to be uploaded to the InfoShare™ case,” explains CSI Account Manager Kim Petty, who was heavily involved in this project.<br><br> ● Victim Services tab (in eProsecution Module) –This area of the suite helps the coordinators track each of the services they deliver to their clients who are victims of crimes or victim survivors. These services need to be categorized and tracked to properly produce their state and federal reports. This, too, has long been an extremely time consuming task for every coordinator. Now, with a click of a button, the coordinators will be able to produce this report in an effective, timely manner. The report is based on data they entered throughout the year. The Victim Services tab was specifically designed in accordance with state and federal guidelines.<br><br> ● Stat-Tracker – This feature works in conjunction with the Victim Services Tab to track, compute, and report on the statistics that are required for federal and state reporting. These statistics support grants, financial aid packages and directly fund some of the Victim Support staff for a number of NJ counties.<br><br> ● The Portal – The portal is one of the hottest new technologies. Victims can register online for the portal with the information provided in their initial contact letter. Once registered to use the portal, victims then can electronically correspond and communicate with the victim witness staff through the portal and all letters and notifications can be received and man-aged electronically. All correspondence is secure and forms, images and documents can be submitted through the portal, making the interaction confidential and streamlined. <br><br><img src='../img/news/news-2017-0209-1.jpg'/><br><br>Those working on this project agree that it has been a great pleasure working with all of the coordinators and their staff. “They are by far some of the most caring, dedicated, and efficient staff we have worked with!” states Petty.<br><br> Those working on this project agree that it has been a great pleasure working with all of the coordinators and their staff. “They are by far some of the most caring, dedicated, and efficient staff we have worked with!” states Petty."},{id:3,title:"The InfoShare™ Municipal Portal: A Better Way for Your Town to do Business!",date:"3/8/2017",type:"news",src:"",body:"Whether you are a large, metropolitan city or a small, suburban town, CSI Technology Group’s secure, cloud-based public portal will simplify transactions between your municipal government and your citizens, while allowing you to provide excellent customer service with reduced resources.<br><br> CSI’s InfoShare™ Municipal Portal provides secure processing and accurate accounting for all municipal transactions.

OPRA Requests Can Turn Costly",date:"4/5/2017",type:"news",src:"",body:"The New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA) continues to strike fear into the hearts of records custodians statewide. While the$600,000.00 plus award of attorney’s fees in an OPRA case out of a central New Jersey municipality sets a standard that will be hard to surpass, awards of attorney’s fees over the last couple years have steadily increased, even while the courts have expanded the scope of information available to the public under OPRA. In Monmouth County, a municipality was ordered to pay in excess of$21,000.00 in attorney’s fees, calculated at the rate of $315.00 per hour of attorney time.<br><br> A state-level law enforcement agency was ordered to pay in excess of $57,000.00 at the rate of $300.00 per hour of attorney time. And a county level agency was ordered to pay in excess of $45,000.00 in attorney’s fees at the rate of $350.00 per hour of attorney time. There has even been an award of $10,000.00 in fees in a case where there were no records to turn over. In addition, rumor has it that there have been other very substantial awards, in the six figure range of fees that have been sealed by agreement of the parties upon settlement of the dispute. These are substantial numbers, both in terms of the fees awarded and the rate at which the attorney’s time is calculated. The lesson is that where OPRA is concerned, the failure to engage and respond in a timely and substantive manner, can be very expensive.<br><br> At the same time, records custodians are faced with an expansion of the scope of the definition of a “government record” under OPRA. In June of 2017, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned an Appellate Court Decision that limited the definition of government record under OPRA to what we normally think of as a record, including those kept in electronic form. Since the publication of Paff v. Galloway Township, (A8815) (077692) published on June 20, 2017, it is now clear that “government record” as the term is used in the OPRA statutes, includes all the electronically stored information related to government activity, whether or not it is related to a more traditional “record” of government activity. The decision does not describe this data other than to say it is “information stored or maintained electronically” by the government. Specifically, the case involved an OPRA request for email header information including sender, recipient, date and time, and subject field data between specific municipal employees for a specific period of time. The request did not include the substance of the related emails. <br><br>The township’s initial response was to deny the request as it did not request existing “records” under the commonly accepted OPRA definition. The township did admit that it had the technical capability to provide the information with little effort, and that they had, under different circumstances, provided similar information in response to a different OPRA request but had discontinued the practice after deciding that they were not required to. These answers, apparently, did not impress the court. Takeaways from the case include: <br><br>1. Case related emails are clearly government records, including any related meta data or other data included in the substance of the communication; <br><br>2. If the government agency can produce the data with minimal technical effort, they must, but if more involved technical assistance is needed, OPRA leaves open the possibility that the requestor may have to pay; <br><br>3. The case does not address in any way or limit the legitimate reasons an agency may have for redacting the data prior to responding to the request, and leaves that issue unaddressed. <br><br>This decision poses a serious dilemma for record custodians who are already faced with very restrictive time limits and harsh penalties for being wrong. Many record custodians may not even know of the existence of data associated with the government records they handle, much less how to extract it and package it for delivery. <br><br>But fear not! CSI Technology Group is working on an OPRA module designed to enhance a record custodian’s ability to search across cases and modules to collect, package, redact and document responses to OPRA requests in a timely manner. The module includes tracking features that allow the custodian to track the timing of OPRA requests and assist in making timely seven day responses and final responses. It also includes redaction features that are similar to CSI’s eDiscovery redaction tools but allow for the documentation of the reasons for each redaction and the automated production of a Vaughn Index, if necessary. We at CSI are here for you, and want to help your agency avoid the substantial awards being handed out in cases such as those mentioned above."},{id:5,title:"Video Clip Tagging is a Snap with InfoShare™’s Axon Video Interface!",date:"4/12/2017",type:"news",src:"",body:"In our effort to provide new and time-saving features for our customers, CSI Technology Group has developed an interface with Axon, makers of Taser Body-Worn Cameras (BWC's), and their cloud-hosted video storage platform, Evidence.com.

The FireRMS allows the users to complete their run reports and NFIRS reports in electronic documents and then print those documents out, with a very professional result.<br><br> In addition to the incident reporting, the InfoShare™ FireRMS gives the agency the ability to maintain an inventory of equipment to include what gear is on what apparatus, which firefighter has which equipment, etc. The system also has expiration dates built in with alerts so that when the end-of-life of certain equipment comes about, the application alerts the proper members of the staff in advance of the expirations. For far too long, this information has been managed, in best case, on a spreadsheet, and, in worse case, by walking around the station opening every compartment and looking at what is there. If this method sounds familiar, InfoShare™ is here to help!<br><br> “A lot of thought and planning has gone into the development of this module for the Fire Service. When the FireRMS is incorporated with the CAD/MDT, the amount of information at your fingertips is astounding,” states Norcross.<br><br> The InfoShare™ CAD has been designed to be lightweight in design as well as fully functional. It can be easily deployed in a command vehicle for significant fires and mass casualty events. This is not a ‘stripped down’ version of the InfoShare™ CAD but a fully functioning application.<br><br> We at CSI Technology Group welcome the opportunity to work with the Fire Service.

All those PDF, text, and Word files that InfoShare™ currently manages, using seamless integration with each case's data, are only a part of the full set of artifacts for a case's evidence, prosecution, and discovery needs. <br><br>“CSI realizes that every prosecutor's office has physical limits and constraints that must be dealt with to store all these forms of evidence that are not contained in the case and document management system,” explains CSI VP and CIO Chris Rein. “This includes physical or virtual storage as well as network bandwidth. Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, CJIS Solutions and the AXON Evidence.com are some of the providers our customers work with today. The emergence of cloud utilization is happening quickly, but will not solve all issues.” <br><br>CSI is excited to announce that our company is about to launch a new set of features and modules that will address the requirements and the constraints that the increased use of these types of files present. CSI’s design and engineering teams have begun work on InfoVideo, InfoShare Media Server, and InfoDownload. These three new products, along with the enhanced eProsecution and eDiscovery modules, comprise our solution. <br><br>Have a look at the high level description of these three new components that will serve your needs:<br><br><h3>InfoShare™ Media Server</h3>○ InfoShare Media server will be a Windows server residing either on a customer's network DMZ or in a cloud provider's domain. It will store video files and can be accessed from internal and external users. ○ Standard Windows server with 10TB disk space, with more storage available upon request <br>○ Storage is configured as RAID 5 <br>○ Token-based authentication and authorization that is verified with token issuer, eProsecution or eDiscovery Portal <br>○ Audit trail system to record file upload, download, update, and delete <br>○ Supports partial upload/download and resuming upload/download <br>○ Web user interface (UI) for file management, system management, and video preview (video preview page can be embedded in eProsecution) <br><br><b>InfoVideo InfoVideo will be a Windows application that can be installed on a user’s computer.

Today, one of modern times’ leading detectives is partnering with CSI Technology Group to bring criminal investigations into the future.<br><br> Dr. Henry Lee, internationally renowned forensic scientist and founder of the Henry C. Lee Institute of Forensic Science at the University of New Haven (UNH), has signed a cooperative agreement with CSI Technology Group and Taipei Technical Institute to establish a joint Research and Development (R&D) Center. One of the first goals of the Center will be to develop a robotic detective they will name Rolmes, a moniker paying tribute to that pipe smoking gumshoe and meaning “Robotic Holmes.”<br><br> A veteran of over 8000 cases, including the OJ Simpson case and the Phil Spector case, Dr. Lee joined UNH’s Forensic Science program nearly four decades ago and helped build it into one of the top forensic studies programs in the United States. For the past thirty-five years, law enforcement officials and students of criminal justice from around the globe have come to UNH to study forensics at the Henry C. Lee Institute of Forensic Science.<br><br> Dr. Lee has also been a consultant with CSI Technology Group since we first started developing applications to support criminal investigations and prosecution, almost twenty years ago. He has also served as a member of CSI’s Board of Directors.<br><br> Taipei Technical Institute is one of Taiwan’s oldest technological universities, and was ranked first among all the other technological universities in the country. The university specializes in three fields: technology, design and management.<br><br> The strengths of these three partners imbue the joint R&D center with a solid core of competency and expertise in the fields of technology, public safety and forensic science. The joint R&D center will focus on developing advanced software technology to secure a bright future for generations of smart city and smart government initiatives.<br><br> The first step in Rolmes’ development was to construct its standard operating procedures (S.O.P.), based on the experience and expertise of Dr. Lee and his team of forensic scientists. This will set the foundation for the design that will support crime scene investigators with fully integrated software and hardware to facilitate the investigation process. Conducting an investigation with the assistance of Rolmes and the embedded S.O.P.’s will eliminate problems resulting from inadmissible evidence or the failure to gather evidence, often incurred with manual evidence collection process without a good step by step guide. Rolmes will support a shorter training cycle for junior investigators, thus allowing experienced investigators to allocate more resources to evidence analysis in the laboratory.<br><br> Rolmes will synchronize the collected data with the cloud database, including photos, videos, and all of the environmental parameters collected from the crime scene. This will be done in real time, via 4G mobile telecommunication technology. The uploaded data/information in the cloud is sharable and available to authorized individuals. Access to the data is controlled through strict, yet configurable, permission settings built into Rolmes. Rolmes will construct a virtual crime scene, according to the collected environmental parameters, which forensic experts and senior detectives in other places can remotely access. They will then be able to give instructions and advice to the on-site investigators. In addition, the Rolmes Expert System (ES) powered by big data analysis will result in more precise and accurate directions for cracking a case more quickly. Rolmes will change the way detectives and investigators work.<br><br> Dr. Lee reveals that the secret of Rolmes is that its kernel algorithm is based on Lee’s decades of knowledge and experience. This includes using the key factors of the over 8,000 major criminal cases in over 46 countries that he has assisted in, as the inference rules in the database. “Investigating a crime with Rolmes will be like working alongside Henry Lee”, says Dr. Lee about his robotic investigator. “Ask Rolmes any question, just like you would ask me if I was there with you.” Lee hopes to see Rolmes and the intelligent technologies continue to evolve, allowing his expertise and experiences to pass from generation to generation.<br><br> “Robots will never replace human beings, but they will enhance our decision making and investigative capabilities,” Lee explains. While Dr. Lee and CSI Technology Group are on the cutting edge of crime scene technology with the development of Rolmes, someday the use of a robotic detective might be quite elementary, don’t you think?"},{id:9,title:"New InfoShare™ Billing and Management Module for Efficient Contracting and Billing",date:"6/28/2017",type:"news",src:"",body:"CSI Technology Group is excited to announce that our new InfoShare™ Billing & Management Module is ready to support law enforcement agencies with the daunting task of managing assignments and contracts for jobs such as roadwork and special events.

This quick access to charging documents has helped prosecutors manage the dangerously short timeline they now have under bail reform to make detention motion decisions, and the necessary filings required to try to keep dangerous criminals off the street.<br><br><h3>NJ Bail Reform: CSI’s ECDR Feed Supports Prosecutors in Meeting the New Requirements</h3><br>The case law tells another side of the story. With the new rules regarding detention hearings going into effect, old arguments about fairness and disclosure of information have been dusted off and re-visited in a new context. There is some limited guidance from the courts. On May 10, 2017, the New Jersey Supreme Court released its decision in State v. Habeed Robinson, (A-40-16) (078900). This decision interprets Court Rule R. 3:4-2(c)(1) (B), setting out the general obligations of the State at a Probable Cause hearing. The Court provides a specific list of what the State is required to turn over to the defense in the event the State files for a detention hearing. These include:<br><br> ○ The complaint <br>○ ThePublic Safety Assessment (PSA) <br>○ The affidavit of probable cause <br>○ Any available Preliminary Law Enforcement Investigation Report (PLEIR) ○ All statements and reports relating to the affidavit of probable cause ○ All statements or reports that relate to any additional evidence the State relies on to establish probable cause <br>○ All exculpatory evidence <br>○ Reports that are in the possession of the prosecutor, law enforcement officials, and other agents of the State <br><br><b>Note that:</b><br>○ Statements and reports related to items that appear only in the PLEIR need not be disclosed <br>○ Statements and reports relating to the risk of flight, danger, and obstruction, which the State advances at the hearing, should be disclosed <br>○ The phrase “statements and reports” refers to items that exist at the time of the hearing and does not encompass video and audio files, as a general rule <br><br>This substantial list of mandatory disclosures at the detention hearing puts the State under tremendous pressure to obtain the relevant records from one or many local law enforcement agencies and provide them to the defense attorney in a form that complies with the law and they can track in the subsequent stages of the case.<br><br> CSI’s CJP/Case Screening module that handles the eCDR data also creates an open document pipeline between the local police department that generates the eCDR and the prosecutor’s office. This facilitates the uploading of the documents that prosecutors are now required to provide at the detention hearing. Further, once the eCDR has been merged into a Promis/Gavel case, all of the standard InfoShare™ discovery tools are at the prosecutor’s disposal to manage the redaction, Bates stamping and release of the relevant discovery documents. We at CSI are committed to continuing to update and revise our software applications to adjust to the new criminal justice environment. <br><br><b>FIRST STATISTICAL REPORT ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IS PUBLISHED</b><br><br> Although statistics can often tell only part of the story, the first statistical analysis of the effects of Criminal Justice Reform in New Jersey has been released by the Administrative Office of the Courts. From January 1, 2017 through the end of May 2017, the statewide average for detained defendants, defendants charged on a warrant, was 13.1%. The counties with the highest rates of detention for defendants charged on warrants were Atlantic with a 25.8% detention rate, and Passaic with a 24.9% detention rate for defendants charged on warrants. By contrast, the detention rate in Camden County was 10.3%. <br><br>The snapshot jail population statistics reflect the same reality. In Bergen County, the pre-trial jail population on May 31, 2015 was 516. Two years later, on May 31 2017, the jail population in Bergen County was down to 313, a 39.3% reductions. Similarly, in Camden County, the May 31, 2015 pre-trial jail population was 875, but on May 31, 2017 was down to 451, a 48.5% reduction.<br><br> An overall comparison of the state wide pre-trial jail population on May 31, 2015, to the pretrial jail population on May 31, 2017, shows that there has been a reduction of 35.7% in pretrial jail populations. The urbanized counties are seeing the largest percentage reductions over all, although some of the dense suburban counties are not far behind."},{id:11,title:"Victim/Witness Outreach: CSI Plans a New App for That!",date:"8/22/2017",type:"news",src:"",body:"CSI is excited to announce that we have begun development of a new mobile application that will integrate with our InfoShare™ Victim-Witness case management software.

The goal of this new project is to provide more efficient response to emergencies and more accurate police reporting, while at the same time taking advantage of the cost savings inherent in shared services.<br><br> To date, ten Camden County towns are now on board with this new, regional effort, and they selected CSI’s InfoShare™ Records Management System (RMS) to support their police departments and provide their towns with the latest technology in police data collection, sharing and reporting. The municipalities are Barrington, Bellmawr, Brooklawn, Oaklyn, Lindenwold, Chesilhurst, Clemention, Runnerede, Pine Hill and Woodlynne. “Prior to installing the new RMS, the officers would submit their reports at the end of their shift. With the new system, we will now have a live feed for sharing data on calls for service, suspects arrested and pending investigations,” explains Bellmawr Police Chief Bill Walsh, who is the Chair for the Camden County Police Chief’s Regional RMS Project. CSI makes this information available to officers through their Mobile Data Terminals (MDT’s). The MDT’s themselves are a testimony to Camden County law enforcement’s pioneering efforts in utilizing shared services, when resources were pooled among police departments to obtain them back in 1996. “This is nothing new to police. We have been sharing equipment and officers since I started in police work,” contends Walsh. “While it wasn’t always documented and we didn’t use the hot word ‘shared services,’ we did what we had to do to get the job done.”<br><br> Having a live feed for police reporting of incidents and emergencies will help not only in report accuracy, but also in response. “The towns in the past would have all different types of records management systems and rarely could they share data. This new system allows all the departments and their officers to share their data, solving crimes more quickly and taking additional criminals off the streets.

CJP means Central Judicial Processing and it allows those counties’ police departments to transmit all indictable arrest documents, including complaints and police reports, to the Prosecutor's Office for timely screening decisions by prosecuting attorneys. The documents are scanned or uploaded to a case initiated by a local police department, creating an electronic case file that can be viewed by all authorized parties, and linking the police case directly to the e-Prosecution case.<br><br>In Mercer County, InfoShare™’s CJP component is being deployed with a slight variation to the established model. CJP has been implemented in the Ewing Township Municipal Court, and it is the municipal court staff that is transmitting the data to the Prosecutor’s Office. Ewing is the first court site to be deployed using the CJP screening model.<br><br>The original copies of the complaints reside at the court, and these must be provided to the Prosecutor’s Office. The current process calls for prosecutor staff to travel weekly to all the municipalities to retrieve the documents for processing back at the office. With the CJP process in place, the time and expenses associated with the pickups are immediately eliminated. If the municipal judge has made notations on these documents, the court has the ability to scan the marked-up documents into the CJP application. Other case documents, such as the Affidavit of Probable Cause, Victim/Witness Notifications, and the Letters of Representation are also scanned into CJP and electronically transmitted to the prosecutor's office, creating an electronic case file that is, within minutes, viewed and assessed by the screening attorneys. With all documents associated to the case, the county prosecutor is provided with a complete set of court documentation for the case, including the judge’s notations, to support the screening process in a timely manner. After screening, those defendant records whose charges have been downgraded, dismissed, or remanded are electronically returned to the courts.<br><br>This module also provides status listing access to the Superior Court and Public Defender to expeditiously identify those cases that will proceed for prosecution and those that have been downgraded or dismissed. Role-based security can be limited or expanded, as needed, to include local police, courts, public defenders' offices, and the Prosecutor’s Office, providing a secure and efficient process for the electronic transmission of all documents necessary to screen or prosecute a case. This customized workflow design enables prosecutors' offices to review and screen cases early in the criminal justice process, thereby eliminating redundant and unnecessary work, including searching for files and documents. All electronic files submitted can be batch printed for attorney review. When the defendant is charged, all documents are associated to the e-Prosecution case file.<br><br>The CJP module eliminates redundant data entry, reduces the chance for data entry errors and ultimately speeds up the time to trial! The Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office plans to expand its new screening model to its other twelve municipal courts in the near future."},{id:5,title:"InfoShare™ 3.0 Provides Versatility in Hosting Options",date:"3/10/2014",type:"news",src:"",body:"<h3>CSI Technology Group Participates in Highlighted IJIS Project</h3><br>Are you ready for the cloud? Or would you rather host InfoShare™ at your own data center? CSI understands that everybody’s situation is different, so with the upgrade to 3.0, we now offer choices when it comes to hosting your application. Another new feature CSI now provides our customers is multiple choices for hosting InfoShare™. Three models are now supported by our new InfoShare™ 3.0 platform:<br> > Locally hosted in your agency's data center or server room.<br> > Operated on a shared government (virtualized or cloud) platform<br> > Operated on a commercial cloud platform Each of these options has its own advantages, so read on to find out which may be best for you:<br><br>A locally and physically hosted system is operated and managed directly under your control, in your facility, on your physical servers. For an enterprise the size of a small to medium county, the cost of a set of servers (hardware, operating system, and database engine) runs from $30K - $60K, depending on your preferences or operational needs. For this discussion, let us assume $45K as your cost for several Intel servers, Windows Server operating system, and Microsoft SQL database engine. In general, there is an annual cost for all hardware and software procurements in the general range of 15% - 18%, which would roughly amount to $6K - $8K. Depending on staffing and IT support arrangements, there would also be indirect costs, including building/facilities, power and a small portion of a Server Administrator's time and resources.<br><br>Use of a virtualized and/or government cloud is a second option that is often available to a county agency, allowing you to run your InfoShare™ application on a county network of shared resources. Usually most state and county governments have either a shared physical server farm, or more recently, a robust virtualized enviroment where the server administrator(s) can provision several “virtual servers“ running on a large, powerful mega-server or blade-server chassis. These virtual servers can have their own logins, IP addresses, application pool and databases. Your InfoShare™ application runs perfectly well on this environment, and a number of county and state (executive branch and judicial branch) InfoShare™ systems operate this way today. Some of these shared server environments are set up to actually operate as a “cloud” (see the next option for details of how a cloud operates). The many variants of this option, based on how your county/agency operates or charges for computing services, make it impractical to compute actual costs here.<br><br>The introduction of InfoShare™ 3.0 provides you the new option of commercial cloud-based computing. While the very term “cloud“ raises debate across the IT industry as to the specific definition of “cloud computing,“ the essential concept is simple: your InfoShare™ software runs on computers that you do not have to ever worry about. You pay a monthly fee and the cloud platform provider (such as Rackspace.com, Amazon Cloud, Microsoft's Azure Cloud, Dimension Data, etc.) manages everything else. Two cloud models that support this are known as IaaS and PaaS. Respectively, these stand for “Infrastructure-as-a-Service“ and “Platform-as-a-Service.“ Your cloud provider will provision the hardware and provide your required amount of memory, disk space, Internet bandwidth and CPU processing power. CSI will install InfoShare™ on this cloud-hosted platform. Software and security updates, firewall upgrades, and hardware maintenance are all performed by your provider. The operational advantages are easy to see, as is the tremendous growth of cloud-hosted environments. For example, as of early 2014, Google Cloud Services, just one of dozens of cloud providers, currently hosts 4 million software applications (not 4 million users, that is 4 million applications). The costs for cloud hosting of these environments vary by several factors, and CSI can help you select the amount of processing power on the cloud that you will need. A very broad price range for a small to moderate sized agency might be $450 - $750 per month for a turn-key cloud platform. Several cloud providers have seen 80% - 90% growth in business over a 2 year period, some even greater. Cloud computing is not a 'maybe' nor is it going to take hold some time in the future. It is here now, it is tremendously successful and InfoShare™ is built to take advantage of it.<br><br>As you see, CSI has provided you with choices and we are happy to work with our customers in any of these operating configurations, as best fits you needs.

Ottenberg, who served as Acting Camden County Prosecutor before joining CSI earlier last year, gave a presentation at the convention on trends in technology and their impact on the law in New Jersey.<br><br>The two hour presentation covered a broad range of topics impacting New Jersey’s county prosecutors’ offices, including some recent cases that discuss the implications of digital records management and the obligations law enforcement agencies have related to them. One such case Josh discussed was State v. Germaine A. Handy (A-108-09). Germaine A. Handy was initially stopped for a violation of a town ordinance prohibiting riding a bicycle on the sidewalk. When the officer asked the dispatcher to run Handy for warrants, the dispatcher mistakenly relayed information regarding a different Handy and a ten year old warrant. The mistaken information was the basis of the search of Handy and the subsequent discovery of controlled dangerous substances, for which he was charged. In upholding the suppression of the evidence, the New Jersey Supreme Court noted that in the dispatcher has a duty to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the information being relayed to an officer on the street is correct.<br><br>The ethical implications for Assistant Prosecutors and prosecuting agencies were also discussed. Simply put, computers never forget, and once a piece of information is put into a digital record keeping system, it is there forever. At the same time, the law imputes to prosecutors knowledge of all the information that comprises the record of the investigation of the case they are prosecuting. Therefore, prosecutors have a duty to understand the scope of the digital record made in the cases they prosecute, including the dispatch system used by the first responding officers, so that they can make rational decisions as to what is discover-able and what is not. R.P.C. 3.4(d) imposes on lawyers the duty to make reasonably diligent efforts to comply with lawful discovery requests by an opposing party. This implies that Assistant Prosecutors are obliged to understand at least the basics of the digital record keeping systems used in their cases so that they can make honest and informed responses to the discovery requests made by defense counsel.<br><br>Ottenberg also touched upon the practical implications of the increased use of digital records. The increased use of digital record keeping systems in the law enforcement world and elsewhere has enhanced the need to assure that digital information is used in a secure virtual environment. In fact, information security, the technical aspects of how digital information is kept secure, is becoming a commonplace concern in a world simultaneously struggling with the implications of the Edward Snowden revelations and the credit card security breaches at some of the world’s largest and most familiar department store chains. The good news for Assistant Prosecutors in particular, but also for lawyers in general, is that the basic purpose of information security, ensuring the confidentiality of information, is also a fundamental concept of the practice of law. Few professions understand the value of confidentiality the way the legal profession does and nowhere are the rules surrounding the issue of confidentiality more complex and important that in law enforcement. The use of basic dual authentication technology and good password security protocols mitigate the threat of an information breach substantially."},{id:9,title:"Sussex County Named as a Top Digital County",date:"5/7/2014",type:"news",src:"news-2014-0507.jpg",body:"CSI congratulates Sussex County, New Jersey on their recognition by the Center for Digital Government and the National Association of Counties for their use of digital technology in government operations.

Section (b)(1)(A) of the rule now mandates that the State turn over, along with all the traditional items, “electronically stored information, and any other data or data compilations stored in any medium from which information can be obtained and translated, if necessary, into reasonably usable form.” This increases the burden on prosecutors to investigate and understand the technology that is used by the investigative agencies."},{id:13,title:"Identity Federation, Standards, and Justice Information Sharing",date:"7/9/2014",type:"news",src:"",body:"CSI Technology Group Participation in NJ-ISE Demonstration<br><br>In our February issue of the InfoSharer, we reported on the preparation, planning, and development of our software to integrate with a project called the New Jersey Information Sharing Environment (NJISE).

Flashers on and siren blaring, he follows the speeding sports car and brings it to a stop about ½  mile down the road. Before getting out of the car, Officer Krupke utilizes his InfoShare™ MDT software and runs a lookup on the plates. He has the ability to do a random NCIC or a full search of several databases that are bundled in the InfoShare™ MDT software. Because Officer Krupke has observed the car speeding, he opts for the full search. With the push of a button, InfoShare™ instantly performs a complete search of the NCIC, NJ AOC, NLETS, and NJ DMV databases. The search results reveal the car belongs to Matthew Shiran of Short Hills, New Jersey, who has no prior convictions.<br><br>Officer Krupke steps out of his car to have a talk with Mr. Shiran. Upon approaching the car, he finds a young woman in the driver’s seat and asks for her credentials. The driver’s license shows her name as Lindsey Shiran, 18 years old, of the same Short Hills address and she matches the photo on the DL. She acknowledges she was speeding and asks if he likes her shiny new car her dad gave her for a high school graduation present. While Ms. Shiran is a bit snippy, Officer Krupke can see nothing else that she has done wrong, so he takes her license and registration back to his patrol car and swipes her driver’s InfoShare Law Enforcement Products Work Together: e-Ticketing, CAD, RMS and more! license through MDT. The InfoShare™ e-ticketing software quickly obtains the biographical information from the DL bar code and auto-populates those fields in the ticket. Additional information from the plate lookup is also added to the ticket, automatically. It then prompts Officer Krupke through a simple user interface to complete the remaining fields on the ticket, including the violation information for the two citations he is issuing, speeding and running the red light. No matter how many tickets an officer needs to issue, no information needs to be reentered, other than the violation number for each ticket. The InfoShare MDT software will auto-populate the personal, incident and vehicle information on each ticket. When done, Officer Krupke pushes the print button and InfoShare™ generates the two separate tickets for each violation! He hands the tickets to Ms. Shiran and advises her to slow down.<br><br>Later on that evening, Officer Krupke One click of “Init CFS” button creates a Call for Service Page 5 observes a black Mercedes driving erratically and at a high rate of speed. He runs the plate through the MDT and the InfoShare search returns a color-coded alert that the car is stolen. Officer Krupke decides to call for backup. Since he has InfoShare™ for CAD software on his MDT and his department is connected to a regional call center also using InfoShare for CAD, he merely pushes the Init CFS button on his MDT to initiate a Call For Service (CFS). Immediately, the Call Center receives the CFS and the InfoShare™ for CAD software automatically calculates that Sergeant Muldoon is available and most accessible to Krupke’s location. As Muldoon is being dispatched to assist Krupke, InfoShare™ automatically transmits the CFS data to Muldoon’s MDT from the CAD, so he knows exactly what type of situation he is facing before he even gets there. Also, Muldoon does not have to take the time to read the details before taking off or avert his eyes from the road, as the voice-activated MDT software will read the details of the CFS to him while he is on his way to the scene./nKrupke has pulled the car over as Muldoon arrives on the scene, and the two officers approach the car and ask the driver to step out. The driver, clearly intoxicated, mumbles a few slurred obscenities and stumbles out of the car. Krupke and Muldoon search his person and his vehicle, cuff him and escort him to Officer Krupke’s car. Muldoon runs his driver’s license through his MDT and finds that he is Bernard Willis of Lawnside, NJ, he has a previous DWI and he is wanted on a warrant for possession of illegal firearms. Mr. Willis is taken to the police station, where he is given a breathalyzer test, booked and shown to a cell to spend the evening. At the station, Officer Krupke uses the InfoShare™ e-ticketing system to issue Willis traffic citations for DWI and reckless driving. CSI equips the police station with the same e-ticketing software the officers have in their cars, along with printers, so Krupke can generate the tickets with the same ease as his previous stop that day. No redundant data entry on the ticket generation and the data transmits automatically to both the police records management database and to the court’s ATS system.<br><br>Officer Krupke then goes to his desk and signs on to the InfoShare RMS. There, all the traffic data about both the Shiran and the Willis incidents have been entered into the RMS database already from the e-ticketing module. For the Willis case, the CAD has sent information about the CFS to the RMS, and that is available to him for his report, as well. Through the RMS, Krupke adds additional reports and arrest documents as needed to complete all the charges being issued to Mr. Willis. Krupke completes this case and sends the Willis case to his supervisor. He then reviews the information already in the database on the Shiran incident, adds some additional notes, and sends that report off to his supervisor for approval, as well.<br><br>Sgt. Muldoon also has the Willis case information already available for his report, as well as other citations he has issued that day, and completes all necessary reports with the same ease and minimal additional entry.<br><br>The next morning, the municipal court clerk signs on to ATS and the information about Bernard Willis’ and Lindsey Shiran’s traffic citations are in the ATS database and she automatically schedules court dates without needing to data enter any ticket information. When the court dates come, the judge will already be able to have the ticket information in front of him in ATS, as he sits on the bench and hears the cases.<br><br>Since Krupke and Muldoon were able to scan or upload copies of all indictable arresting documents for Willis’ felony charges into the InfoShare™ RMS and their county prosecutor’s office has InfoShare™ e-Prosecution software, including the CJP module, the Prosecutor’s system will have all of the information and documents that were submitted by the officers, once approved by their supervisors and transmitted electronically to the Prosecutor’s Office. With the push of the “Send to Prosecutor” button, InfoShare™ automatically creates an electronic case file for the Willis case at the Prosecutor’s Office and all indictable arrest documents, complaints and police reports are sent to the prosecutor's office for timely screening decisions by prosecuting attorneys. The InfoShare™ e-Prosecution case management software will process the case and the data gathered by Krupke and Muldoon at the scene will be seamlessly integrated into the Prosecutor’s case file. The InfoShare™ integration between the police, court and prosecutor will provide access to the case data to all authorized parties and facilitate further updates and communication among all involved.<br><br>CSI continues to bolster its product line with new products utilizing the latest in mobile, GPS and data transfer technology to streamline the work of public safety, prosecutors and judiciary organizations.

We have b e c o m e “CONNECTED” to the point that our officers’ daily tasks are dependent upon and interconnected with software, hardware and the Internet.<br><br>Today’s law enforcement officer is a bona fide member of the advanced twenty-first century electronic age. But as law enforcement agencies implement new technology to keep up with today’s public safety demands, they often find themselves in a dilemma of relying on existing resources when making this transition. Often, a department will appoint somebody who has some technical experience to be the IT Administrator, but due to budgetary constraints, cannot provide formal education to them on administering the new technology they have been put in charge of. Sometimes, required hardware and software to properly construct firewalls and provide protection from attacks is not installed, most likely, again, due to budgetary limitations. Sometimes corners are cut by just not implementing the proper security barriers and protective domes to protect the networks that house these new, advanced, mission-critical systems.<br><br>Law enforcement agencies have recently seen an increase in system attacks attempting to cripple the networks they rely upon on a daily basis to protect the citizens of their communities. Without measures and controls securing your network, your data is vulnerable to one or more of these attacks. Some attacks are minor, such as when unauthorized data is changed or monitored within the physical location, or via external connections to public and private networks. Some are much more serious and encompass data being altered, corrupted or records completely wiped out. Some are even direct or indirect attacks on networks used to connect law enforcement assets working with data to complete their assignments.<br><br>The basic attacks to a system and/or network can be classified into the following categories:<br><br>• Eavesdropping (Sniffing): Your data is in an unsecure format and is monitored and read by an unauthorized party as it travels to its authorized destination.<br><br>• Data Modification: The individual(s) that are attacking your data or network can modify or damage your data or network without the knowledge of the recipient or the sender.<br><br>• Identity Spoofing (IP Address falsely assumed): Attackers will use a falsely assumed IP address to construct data packets using a false IP address that appears to be at a valid address from a legitimate, authorized party. After gaining entry to the network,the attacker(s) can rewrite, reroute, or delete valid data.<br><br>• Password-Based Intrusions: Attacker (s) will use brute force or social engineering to obtain valid passwords that are then used by the attacker(s) to access the target networks or applications. They will then have the same rights and authorization as the valid password user had. For example, if an administrator’s password is compromised, the attacker (s) will have the same access level to the network and/or application as the valid user has, in this instance, an administrator. As an administrator, the attacker(s) will then have the ability to access user lists, change user permissions, add users to the tables, modify hardware configurations, modify, change, or delete data.<br><br>• Denial of Service Attacks (DOS): A DOS prevents the normal use of your computers, servers, or applications by authorized users. Upon attacking your network with a DOS attack, the individual(s) may commence with a false attack which directs the available resources to handle this initial diversionary attack. Meanwhile, a secondary or multiple attacks are initiated on the targeted system as available resources are concentrating on the initial, diversionary attack. Other types of DOS attacks include the sending of invalid application data, causing abnormal behavior in the application(s) or network services. A DOS causes an overload of the computer or a network with traffic resulting in a shutdown, or a blocking of the valid traffic, which results in a loss of access to the network resources by authorized personnel.<br><br>• Man in the Middle Attack: When an entity between the valid users (sender and receiver) is monitoring and controlling valid data transparently to the valid users, and has the ability to reroute the data or gain competitive advantage by using the data.<br><br>• Compromised-Key Attack: An attacker or attackers gain access to an electronic pass key to gain access to application data without any of the authorized sender/ receiver parties knowing that the data-key and the data has been compromised. The attacker(s) may then manipulate the data, and use the compromised key to formulate many other keys that may allow the attacker( s) to compromise other organization data.<br><br>• Packet Sniffer: Attacker(s) use a software or hardware device that will read, monitor, capture or reroute date packets that are encapsulated, but not encrypted. The device allows the attacker(s) to view the data inside of the encapsulated packets and gain"},{id:21,title:"INFOSHARE™ SUPPORTS SHARING SERVICES, SAVING RESOURCES, INCREASING SAFETY",date:"12/26/2014",type:"news",src:"news-2014-1226.jpg",body:"In these times when shared services are being utilized to save resources and increase public safety, CSI’s law enforcement product line facilitates collaboration among police departments forming regional alliances.
